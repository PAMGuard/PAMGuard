<h1>Writing plug-in displays</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2><br>
Plug in displays are designed to sit in the bottom of scrolling spectrogram 
windows and display time series data which are not suitable fo roverlaying over
the spectrgram display itself. 
<p>
plug in diplays take their time axis directly fromt he spectrogram display 
so that whatever is displayed is time aligned with the spectrogram data. 
<p>
To create plug in displays, the developer must create two separate classes
<ol>
<li><a href="../Layout/DisplayPanelProvider.html">DisplayPanelProviders</a>
are used within PAMGuard to make a list of possible display
panels that may be incorporated into other displays. </li>
<li><a href="../Layout/DisplayPanel.html">DisplayPanels</a>
provide a graphics panel 
that is incorporated into the display, taking it's time information from
the display.
</ol>
