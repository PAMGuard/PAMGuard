  <h1>The Likelihood Detector Module</h1>
  <h2>Configuring the Likelihood Detector</h2>
  Once there is a Likelihood detector module added to the PamGuard system, the module
  can be configured by selecting the <code>Detection-&#62</code> menu item and choosing
  the menu option with the name that was supplied when the module was added.
  <br><br>
  If this is the first time the module has been configured, then a
  dialog resembling the following will appear.
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center">
    <caption align="bottom">Likelihood Detector Parameters Dialog</caption>
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/parameters-dialog.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Selecting an Audio Data Source</h2>
  Located at the top of the Likelihood Detector configuration dialog is the standard
  PamGuard <code>Raw Data Source</code> management panel. Using the drop-down box
  you can select a single audio source for the module. A Likelihood Detection module
  can only have one audio source. If you would like to process multiple target 
  configurations on multiple audio sources simultaneously, you will need to add another
  Likelihood Detection module. See the section on 
  <a href="LikelihoodDetector_NewModule.html">adding a new Likelihood Detection module</a>
   for more information.
  <br><br>
  You can also select which channels of audio data to process. By default, all channels
  will be selected, but by using the checkboxes you can filter out specific channeles.
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center">
  <caption align="bottom">Selecting an audio source</caption>
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/selecting-audio-source.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Adding a Target Configuration</h2>
  To add a new target configuration to the Likelihood Detector module, right-click
  on the "Target Configurations" row in the list box and select 
  <code>"Add Configuration"</code>.
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center">
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/new-config.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  A dialog box will open and prompt you to enter a unique name for the target 
  configuration. The dialog will not allow you to enter in a name that is already
  taken. Note that target configuration names are <i>case sensitive</i>.
  <br><br>
  <h3>General Parameters</h3>
  Once a target configuration is added, it will be displayed in the configuration
  area, showing the default values for the general parameters. These general parameters
  are discussed in brief below.
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center">
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/general-parameters.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>Time and Frequency Resolutions</i><br>
        The time resolution and frequency resolution parameters provide
        configurable values that are used in conjunction with the audio source 
        properties in order to derive the signal processing settings for the 
        Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) process found at the start of the processing
        stream. The FFT process operates on the raw input data, converting 
        it to the frequency domain. A Hann window (raised cosine) is used in 
        all cases. Note that changes in sample rate do not require a change to 
        the various settings.
        <br><br>
        For very short signals (&#60 50ms) the time_res should be on the order of the 
        signal duration to twice that. Setting it to be much larger than the signal duration 
        will reduce the detectors ability to detect low SNR (weak) signals.
        <br><br>
        For longer signals, a time_res less than the signal is appropriate, and helps 
        to get better detection timing. The default of 0.1 seconds is often appropriate. 
        The data is still averaged over the length of a signal (using the signal window 
        parameter) in the Normalizer block. This is a sliding window, which is more 
        appropriate for several reasons.
        <br><br>
        The frequency resolution is normally set to <code>freq_res = 1 / (2 * time_res)</code>
        which results in 50% overlap. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <i>Algorithm </i>
      <br>
      This parameter specifies the normalization algorithm that is
      to be used for the target configuration. There are two possible normalizers:
      Decaying Average and Block Average. The Decaying Average algorithm uses 
      feedback to generate estimates similar to the Click Detector. The Block Average
      algorithm averages a specified block of data history.
      <br><br> 
      In general, the block averager is a better choice because it doesn't have a 
      long-term memory. For signal processors the block average is like an 
      FIR filter, whereas the decaying averager is like an IIR filter.
      <br><br>
      The normalizer produces a likelihood ratio L = S / N. 
      <br><br>
      Here are some guidelines for normalization:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For the block averager, a good choice for the signal window is the duration 
            of the click or call being detected, while the noise window should be at least 
            3 times longer. If the actual signal's duration is variable, the signal 
            window can be biased to the longer cases. If the difference between short and 
            long duration signals is significant (more than 2x), another option is to create 
            multiple bands each tuned to the different durations. The noise window shouldn't 
            be so long as to cause neighbouring signals to be in the noise window during 
            detection. For example, if the real signal's duration is 1.0 seconds and 
            the inter-call interval (time between start of one call and the start of 
            the next call) is 3.0 seconds a noise window of 5 seconds would be appropriate, 
            but a noise window of 10.0 seconds would be too long. In this case the 
            longest suggested noise window would be 5 seconds to avoid corrupting the 
            noise estimate with other signals of interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the decaying averager, which uses feedback to generate estimates similar 
            to the click detector, a different strategy for selecting signal and noise windows 
            is appropriate. The signal window can still be on the order of the duration of 
            the vocalization of interest, though it will effectively smear out the signal 
            if many more times than the time resolution. As a general rule of thumb, it 
            should not be more than 4 times the time resolution. The noise window needs 
            to be longer, especially if loud calls are occurring frequently, or the noise 
            estimate will develop a bias due to the feedback.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><i>Minimum detection interval:</i>
    <br>
      This parameter indicates the minimum interval between individual detections. If two or more
      detections occur within this configured amount of time, then they will be considedered all
      part of the same event, and will be considered one detection.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Parameter Tooltips</h3>
    Most of the target configuration parameters have legal bounds that are determined
    either by the audio data source's parameters or by other target configuration
    parameter values. In order to ease configuration of the Likelihood Detector module,
    tool tips are provided in the configuration dialog. Leaving the mouse pointer over 
    a parameter's value in the <code>Value</code> column of the dialog's target configuration
    window will display a tool tip indicating the valid lower and upper bounds for a 
    parameter. The bounds displayed by the tool tip will be enforced by the editing
    widget for the parameter.
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center" border="1">
    <caption align="bottom">Showing a parameter's tool tip</caption>
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/tooltip.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <br></br>
  <blockquote>
  <i>Note: Some parameters are co-dependent, for example the signal/guard band's noise window and the
    signal window. To be able to enter the value you want, it may be necessary to alter a dependent
    parameter. The tool tips will help you with this by explaining if any parameter boundries are
    dependent on another parameter.</i>
  </blockquote>
 <h3>Editing a Parameter</h3>
    All of the configurable parameters for a target configuration are editable in-place
    within the configuration dialog. To edit a parameter, simply double-click with the left
    mouse button on a value in the <code>Value</code> column and an editing widget will
    appear.<br><br>
    The editing widget for a parameter will enforce the valid values on the numbers that
    are entered.

    parameter. The tool tips will help you with this by explaining if any parameter boundries are
    dependent on another parameter.</i>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Parameter Validation</h3>
    The Likelihood Detector's configuration dialog provides validation of user input. When a tool tip
    displays a range of valid values (see Parameter Tooltips, above) the configuration dialog will
    give live feedback to the operator by disallowing invalid characters and values to be entered. This
    feature works in conjunction with the error reporting described below.
    <br><br>
    The Java Validator used to implement the validation can be very literal with what it allows you to
    type. Here are some helpful hints to keep in mind when entering floating-point values:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>You can hit the ESCAPE key at any time to cancel editing and return the parameter to its original
        value.</li><br>
      <li>If you want to type a fractional number beginning with zero (e.g., 0.5), make sure you type 
        the zero first. The validator may get confused if you type ".5".</li><br>
      <li>Sometimes deleting digits from the middle of a number creates an invalid value and the validator
        will attempt to correct it for you. You can always select the whole number with the mouse or the
        keyboard and start over.</li>
    </ul>
  <blockquote>
  <i>Note: Some parameters are co-dependent, for example the signal/guard band's noise window and the
    signal window. To be able to enter the value you want, it may be necessary to alter a dependent
    parameter. The tool tips will help you with this by explaining if any parameter boundries are
    dependent on another parameter.</i>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Error/Warning reporting</h3>
  When a new target configuration is added, or when all of the signal bands for
  a target configuration have been removed, the target configuration isn't valid.
  Since a configuration isn't valid without at least one signal band, the
  target configuration selection box will display a red border prompting you to 
  add a signal band.
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center" border="1">
    <caption align="bottom">Invalid configuration error with tool tip showing</caption>
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/needs-signal-band.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <br><br>
  While editing a target configuration parameter, if the text entered isn't valid or
  is not within the allowed legal boundries for the parameter, then the configuration
  dialog will display a red border around the parameter's editor and keep the editing
  focus there until a valid value is entered.
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center" border="1">
    <caption align="bottom">A parameter error while editing</caption>
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/invalid-value.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <br><br>
  Since many of the target configuration's parameters have legal boundries based on
  audio data source parameters or on other configuration parameters, it is possible that
  a change to a parameter will invalidate some other parameter in a target configuration.
  In addition, a change to an audio data source may invalidate values in one or more 
  whole target configurations.<br><br>
  If this condition occurs, then the existance of invalid parameter(s) will be indicated in two ways:
  <ul>
    <li> The background colour for the entire value box for the parameter will change to
      red until the parameter is adjusted.
    </li>
    <li> The target configuration activation checkbox will change its state to inactive
      and will display a red border around it until the parameter is adjusted.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <table class="image" align="center" border="1">
    <caption align="bottom">A parameter dependency error</caption>
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/parameter-dependency-error.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <br><br>
    In certain cases, a value can be within an accepted range, but it will produce an undesirable
    result. For example, the Noise Window parameter of the signal and guard bands will produce a
    warning if it is set to a value that is greater-than or equal to the time resolution times 500.
    In this case, the warning is provided to make the user aware of the increased processing
    load that would be required.
    <br><br>
    When a warning condition is detected, the configuration dialog will change the background of
    that parameter to yellow:

  <h2>Adding a Signal Band</h2>
  To add a new signal band to a target configuration, right click on the 
  <code>Detection Bands</code> tree item for the name of the
  target configuration you wish to add a new band to, and a pop-up dialog will appear.
  Select the <code>Add Signal Band</code> menu option. You will be prompted to add a
  new unique signal band identifier for the target configuration. The band name 
  dialog will ensure that the identifier you choose is unique.

    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <h3>Signal Band Parameters</h3>
  When a new signal band is added, the Likelihood Detection module will add a series of
  default parameter values for the band.The default thresholds should be acceptable for 
  most environments but can be lowered if the detector has too many missed detections,
  or raised if the detector is generating too many false detections. These are shown 
  and described below:
  <br><br>
  <table class="image" align="center" border="1">
    <caption align="bottom">Signal band parameters</caption>
    <tr><td>
      <img src="images/signal-band-parameters.png"/>
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li><i>In-Band Threshold</i><br>
      The threshold in Decibels for the in-band Likelihood Ratio test 
      (ie signal versus noise estimate threshold). The trigger level for 
      each detection is recorded in the database, which may support threshold selection. 
    </li>
    <li><i>Guard Band Threshold</i><br>
      The threshold in Decibels of the guard band ratio test.  If the average of all 
      guard bands signal estimate versus the in-band signal estimate band 
      is less than the threshold, there is a target present.  Otherwise, the 
      detection is prevented by the guard band.    
    </li>
    <li><i>Start/Min Frequency and End/Max Frequency</i><br>
      It is normal to define the band low and high frequency to contain 
      the entire expected signal, or at least that portion of the signal that 
      contains the most energy.  
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Noise Window</i><br>
      The noise window parameter represents the amount of time around the
      signal that is used for background noise estimation. How the noise
      window parameter should be configured is dependent on the type of
      normalization that is being used. See the 
      <i>Guidelines for Normalization</i> section above for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Signal Window</i><br>
      The signal window is the representation of the duration of the click or call
      that is being searched for. How the signal window should be configured is
      dependent on the type of normalization that is being used. See the
      <i>Guidelines for Normalization</i> section above for more information.

  <h2>Enabling and Disabling a Target Configuration</h2>
    A single Likelihood Detection module can have many different target configurations
    configured, but not all of them need to be active during a detection run. 
    <br><br>
    Enabling and disabling a target configuration is as easy as selecting the 
    target configuration checkbox located next to the name of the target configuration
    in the configuration tree.
