  <h1>The Likelihood Detector Module</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  The likelihood detector module is an implementation of a likelihood ratio 
  test. It is suitable for detecting both short duration Odontocete clicks 
  (Sperm, Beaked, etc.) as well as moderate duration Mysticete calls 
  (Humpback, Bowhead, etc.). It is not suitable for detecting whistles; for more
  information on whistle detection see the Whistle Detector Module.
  <br><br>

  <h2>Design Overview</h2>
  The Likelihood Detector allows for the custom configuration of one or more
  target profiles. Each target profile configuration allows the operator to
  specifiy a series of parameters that identify the characteristics of the
  signal to be detected.<br><br>

  <br><br>

  For each target configuration, the Likelihood module will create a processing
  stream composed of various processes which carry out the detection procedure.
  There is no limit to the number of target configurations that may be 
  prepared, however additional hardware and software performance will be consumed
  for each processing stream.

  <h2>Data Flow</h2>
  The data flow begins with an audio data source (i.e., a Sound Acquisition 
  module), and the Likelihood Detection Module requires an audio data source
  to be configured in order to operate. From there, raw audio data goes through
  several stages of processing, each with its dedicated process, before the
  processing stream emits detections. The stages are as follows:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <i>FFT Processing</i><br>
      When a target configuration is created, the first thing the Likelihood
      Detection Module does is calculate the actual FFT parameters required based on
      the operator's suggestions for the frequency and time resolutions and the
      audio data source's parameters.
      The module will then seek an existing
      FFT data block within the PAMGuard system that has those parameters and is
      also for the same configured audio source. If a matching FFT process is not
      located, an FFT process is automatically created within the Likelihood
      Detection Module, and becomes the first step in the processing stream for
      the target configuration. The output of this stage of processing is a standard
      PAMGuard FFT data block (i.e., <code>RecyclingDataBlock&#60FFTDataUnit&#62</code>).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <i>Linear Average Spectra Processing</i><br>
      This process computes the average band energy for all of a target configuration's
      bands by averaging the FFT magnitude between the start and end frequencies for
      that band. The output of this stage of processing is a <code>
      PamDataBlock&#60AverageSpectraDataUnit&#62.</code>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <i>Spectral ETI Processing</i><br>
      This process computes the average band energy for all of the bands in a target
      configuration by averaging the FFT magnitude between the minimum (start) and 
      maximum (end) frequencies for the bands.
      The output of this stage of processing is a 
      <code>PamDataBlock&#60SpectralEtiDataUnit&#62</code>.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <i>Normalization Processing</i><br>
      The normalizer process computes a signal and noise window estimate based on the 
      configured normalization algorithm (i.e., either decaying average or
      block average) and the configured signal and window lengths.
      The output of this stage of processing is a 
      <code>PamDataBlock&#60NormalizedDataUnit&#62</code>.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <i>Threshold Detection Processing</i><br>
      The detection process computes the actual likelihood ration test (LRT)
      portion of the detection process. This algorithm does two tests: first, for any
      given signal band, if the likelihood ration is greater than the user defined
      threshold, then a detection may be present. Second, if defined, and there may be a detection
      present, the detector divides the signal estimate of the signal-band by the average
      signal estimate af all of the associated guard bands. If that ratio is 
      greater than the user-defined threshold, then a detection results.
      The output of this stage of processing is zero to many
      <code>ThresholdDetectorDataUnit</code>, which is an extension of the standard
      PAMGuard <code>PamDetection&#60&#62</code> class.
