<h1>ROCCA</h1>
<h2>Saved Files</h2>
<br>
<p>ROCCA saves three different files during manual whistle contour
extraction and classification: whistle wav file clip, contour points
and contour variable measurements. During automated click or whistle
analysis, ROCCA only saves the measured variables to the contour
variables file. ROCCA will also saves school stats automatically every
five minutes,
as well as when the <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html#SaveNow">&lt;Save Encounter&gt;</a> button is clicked.</p>
<p>If a database module is being used, ROCCA will also save the
data to two tables: Rocca_Whistle_Stats and Rocca_Encounter_Stats.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="individ">Whistle Clip</a></h3>
<p>The whistle clip is saved with a wav format to the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#OutputDir">output directory</a>.
The start and end points of the clip are defined by the start and end
points originally selected by the user in the spectrogram popup. The
channels saved to the clip file are specified in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_SourceTab">ROCCA Parameters</a>
window.</p>
<p>The filename is defined by the user in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsFilename">ROCCA
Parameters</a> window</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Contour Points</h3>
<p>The time/frequency pair for each contour point in the extracted whistle contour is saved in
CSV format in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#OutputDir">output
directory</a>. The duty cycle, the energy in a frequency bin
around the peak frequency (as defined in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsClassifier">ROCCA
Parameters</a> window), and the RMS value of the amplitude are
also saved.</p>
<p>The filename is defined by the user in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsFilename">ROCCA
Parameters</a> window</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="contour">Contour Variables</a></h3>
<p>The variables measured from the current whistle contour/click, as
well as
the species classification (if a whistle), are saved in CSV format
in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#OutputDir">output
directory</a>.
The information from each whistle/click is appended to the end of the
file and the file is never overwritten. Thus, this file will continue
to collect classification information every time PAMGuard/ROCCA is run.</p>
<p>Other saved information for each whistle includes the sound
source,
the analysis date and time, the encounter number, and any notes included in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_Notes">ROCCA Parameters
Notes</a>
tab. The end of each row lists the name of the random forest model, the
random forest tree votes for each species and a list of
the species included in the classifier. The species names were added to each row instead of
the header line because the header would be created based on
information from the very first whistle contour analyzed only. If the
classification model is changed for subsequent analysis, the species
list may be different and no longer match the header. By including the
species list in the row, the user is always able to verify which
species were included in the classification algorithm for that
particular whistle contour or click.</p>
<p>The filename is specified in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsOutput">ROCCA
Parameters</a> window.</p>
<p>If a database module is being used, the data will also be
saved to the Rocca_Whistle_Stats table.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="school">Encounter Stats</a></h3>
<p>All encounter numbers, with the species classification
break-down for each, are saved as a CSV file in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#OutputDir">output directory</a>.
Also included for each encounter number is the overall encounter
duration, the duration of the whistles only, the duration of the clicks
only, the number of whistles/clicks, the minimum/maximum/average time
between whistles/clicks, the number of
whistles/clicks per second, the whistle/click density (the sum of the
individual durations / encounter length), the whistle/clicks overlap
(the total number of seconds that two whistles/clicks overlap), the
cumulative random forest tree vote totals for each species, as well as
a species list and the overall encounter classification (based on the
species with the highest cumulative tree vote total).</p>
<p>Each time the encounter stats file is saved, either through the
auto-save function or by the user pressing the <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html#SaveNow">&lt;Save
Encounter&gt; button</a>, the file is overwritten in order to
update any renamed encounter numbers. Since an encounter number can be
renamed but never deleted, no information will be lost when overwriting
an old file during a single PAMGuard session. HOWEVER, if PAMGuard is
closed and restarted the file will be <strong>overwritten with
blank data and all prior information will be lost</strong>. The
file is checked during PAMGuard startup, and if it exists the user is
given the opportunity to rename it before it is lost, and/or load the
existing data back into the system.</p>
<p>Note that when examining a particular encounter number, the
user should refer to the species list at the end of the row instead of
the species listed in the header. The header information is taken from
the first encounter number listed; if subsequent encounter numbers use
a different classification model, the species may change and this
change would not be reflected in the header.</p>
<p>The filename is specified in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsOutput">ROCCA
Parameters window</a>.</p>
<p>If a database module is being used, the data will also be
saved to the Rocca_Encounter_Stats table.</p>
