<h1>ROCCA</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The ROCCA (Real-time Odontocete Call Classification Algorithm)
module is intended to provide a set of measured variables for detected
acoustic events. The variables differ depending on whether the acoustic
detection is a delphinid whistle or click. ROCCA uses these parameters
in conjunction with a user-selected random forest classification model
to classify the whistle or click to species. Three random forest models
are available; one for odontocete species in the northwest Atlantic,
one for species in the temperate Pacific and one for species in the
waters surrounding Hawaii.</p>
<p>Individual
whistle/click detections and classifications are grouped into
user-defined <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html">Encounter
Numbers</a>. An encounter is defined as&nbsp;a set of
whistles and/or clicks that
can all be attributed to one school of odontocetes. Variables
describing the acoustic behavior of the encounter are <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html#SchoolClassification">
measured</a> from the
whistle and click detections for that encounter. Each encounter is
classified based on information from detected whistles, clicks and
ancillary variables using the encounter classifier,&nbsp;or as the
species with the highest number of random forest tree votes if no event
classifier has been selected. </p>
<br>
<h3>Delphinid Whistles</h3>
<p>ROCCA classifies delphinid whistles based on spectrographic
measurements extracted from whistle contours. The contour extraction
algorithm <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html">measures</a>
50 different variables for each contour. Whistles can be classified
based on measurements taken manually or based on measurements taken
automatically. Manual classifiers are available for species in the
tropical Pacific Ocean (TropPacWhist.model) and for species in the
northwest Atlantic
(NWAtlWhist.model). Automated whistle
classifiers are available for species in the northwest Atlantic
(NWAtlWhist_auto.model),
the temperate Pacific (TempPacWhist_auto.model) and the waters
surrounding Hawaii (HIWhist_auto.model).</p>
<p>The manual classifier requires seven main steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>User selects a whistle from the spectrogram display by
drawing a box around it using the cursor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whistle is captured by ROCCA and displayed in a new
spectrogram window
window</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whistle contour is traced either automatically by
ROCCA or
manually using the cursor. The user can manipulate the trace, if
desired</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time-frequency points are automatically extracted from
the contour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contour parameters are automatically measured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contour is classified using the currently-loaded
classifier model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The classified whistle statistics are added to the
specified Encounter in the GUI display and the saved
data files</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ROCCA can also be used in conjunction with the <a href="../../whistleMoanHelp/docs/whistleMoan_Overview.html">Whistle
&amp; Moan Detector</a> module to measure and classify
whistles detected and extracted automatically.</p>
<br>
<h3>Odontocete Clicks</h3>
<p>ROCCA <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html">measures</a>
17 variables from clicks passed to it by the <a href="../../clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickDetector.html">Click
Detector</a> module. Each click is classified to species based on
these variables and the currently loaded classifier model, and the
click statistics are added to the specified&nbsp;Encounter
in the GUI display and the saved data files.</p>
<p>Classifiers are available for species in the tropical Pacific
Ocean (TropPacClick.model),&nbsp;the northwest Atlantic
(NWAtlClick.model), the temperate Pacific (TempPacClick.model) and the
waters surrounding Hawaii (HIClick.model).</p>
<br>
<h3>Encounters</h3>
<p>ROCCA <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html">measures</a>
17 variables from the whistles and clicks classified within each
encounter. The encounter is classified to species based on
these variables and the currently loaded classifier model, and the
results are passed to the GUI display and the saved data files.
&nbsp;Note that if no encounter classifier has been specified, the
encounter will be classified based on the species in the encounter with
the highest cumulative percentage of random forest tree votes.</p>
<p>Classifiers are available for encounters in the tropical Pacific
Ocean (TropPacEnc.model),&nbsp;the northwest Atlantic
(NWAtlEnc.model), the temperate Pacific (TempPacEnc.model) and the
waters surrounding Hawaii (HIEnc.model).</p>
