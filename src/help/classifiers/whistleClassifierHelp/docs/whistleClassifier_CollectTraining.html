<h1>Whistle Classifier</h1>
<h2>Collecting Training Data</h2>
<p>
  From the Whistle Classifier Settings dialog, select "Collect Training Data" and the dialog
  will change to show training data parameters in it's lower half.

<br>  
<p>During the collection of training data, whistles will be extracted from raw audio data and
stored in a file, or set of files on your hard drive ready for 
<a href="whistleClassifier_Training.html">Discriminant Function Training</a> at a later date</p>

<h3>Data Organisation</h3>
<p>Although in principle, the classifier can collect training data in real time (i.e. directly from a 
sound card connected to a hydrophone in the water, it is far more likely that you will 
be training your classifier based on a set of previously recorded sound files which you 
have archived over a period of time.</p> 
<p>Sound files should ideally all be recorded at the same sample rate and have the same number 
of channels. If possible, organise your sound files so that you have one file folder 
per species and all the species folders are sub folders of a master training data folder as shown below.</p>
<br>

<br>  
<p>Organising your data in this way is not essential, but it does mean that processing of all files
can take place as a single operation (e.g. over the weekend)</p>

<h4>Sound Acquisition</h4>
<p>Set up your 
<a href="../../../sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionFileFolder.html">
Sound Acquisition module</a> to analyse data from file folders, set the file folder to be the 
root directory containing your folders of files by species and check the option to include sub
folders. Do not check the option to merge contiguous files so that processing stops and starts 
at the end of each file.</p>

<br>  
 

<h4>Species Names</h4>
<p>If your data have been organised into folders as described above, the classifier can use the 
folder names as species names.</p>
<p>If your data are not organised in the way described above, then you will need to enter the species name 
for the training set you are working on (which should of course now be just of a single species).</p>

<h4>Storage Folder</h4>
<p>Training data are stored in files with the ending .wctd (Whistle Classifier Training Data). 
One wctd file will be created for each sound file analysed. Use the Browse button to select the folder you 
want these files to be stored in.</p>

<h4>Running</h4>
<p>Run PAMGuard. All the files in the directory structure of training data will be processed and .wctd files 
created in your output folder. The main classifier display will show distributions of whistle fragment parameter
but will not be performing classification.</p>
<p>There are of course other ways of organising your training data. For instance, if you wish to add new data to 
an already existing training set, it is not necessary to reprocess all the data. </p>
<p>Once you have created your .wctd files, you will need to run the 
<a href="whistleClassifier_Training.html">Discriminant Function Training</a>
 before you can use the 
classifier on new data</p>
