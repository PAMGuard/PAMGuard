	<h2 id="viewing-and-exporting-results">Viewing and exporting
		results</h2>
	<p>Output from the deep learning module can be viewed in PAMGuard
		viewer mode, or extracted from binary files using MATLAB or R.</p>
	<h3 id="PAMGuard-viewer-mode">PAMGuard viewer mode</h3>
	<p>Detections form continuous raw data are shown in the datagram in
		the same way as all data streams in PAMGuard.</p>
	<p>The Time base display FX is best way to view detailed data
		outputs from the deep learning algorithm. The time base display can
		display almost all data types in PAMGuard on a large variety of
		different data axis. For example, click detections can be displayed on
		an amplitude, bearing, ICI, waveform and/or frequency axis. Deep
		learning detections (i.e. data units which have been saved from raw
		data using the deep learning detector) can be displayed on the time
		base display in the same way as many other detections and in addition,
		there is a symbol manager options which allows the deep learning
		detections or other detections which have been classified by the deep
		learning module to be coloured by prediction class. This means that a
		manual analyst can quickly navigate to detections with high prediction
		values for a certain class. Hovering over or right clicking on a data
		unit in the time display and selecting the information button, will
		show the data unit's metadata, including the prediction values for all
		output classes from the deep learning model.</p>

		<em>An example click detection module output coloured by deep
			learning annotations. Click detections are annotated with the results
			from the deep learning module. The symbol manager in the time base
			display can be used to colour the clicks by the prediction for a
			selected class</em>
	</p>
	<p>Other displays also show outputs from the deep learning module.
		Hovering over data units in the click display will, for example, show
		deep learning prediction values. The spectrogram will also show deep
		learning detections as translucent blue boxes (these must be selected
		in the right click menu).</p>
	<h3 id="matlab">MATLAB</h3>
	<p>The easiest way to export to MATLAB is to select the desired
		units in the time base display, right click and select the MATLAB
		icon. Data units will be exported to a .mat file as list of structures
		which is then saved to the clipboard. This file can be saved and then
		dragged into MATLAB to open.</p>
	<p>
		Where it is necessary to further analyse large datasets produced by
		PAMGuard, there is a MATLAB-PAMGuard library which can directly import
		the binary files which store PAMGaurd detection data. The library is
		simple to use with the primary function being
		<code>loadPAMGuardBinaryFile.m.</code>
		This will load any binary file type (e.g. clicks, whistles, deep
		learning detections) and return a list of data structures with the
		detection data. The structures include annotations where deep learning
		predictions are stored.
	</p>
	<p>Here is a simple example loading up all the deep learning
		detections for a right whale classifier.</p>
	<pre>
<code class="lang-matlab">
% the folder containing PAMGuard binary files
folder = '/Users/me/right_whale_project_1/PAMBinary/'; 
%load all the detections in the folder
dldetections = loadPamguardBinaryFolder(folder, 'Deep_Learning_Classifier_Raw_Deep_Learning_Classifier_DL_detection_*.pgdf')
</code>

	</pre>
	<p>The predictions for each class (in this case the classes are
		noise and right whale) are easily accessed in the structure via;</p>
	<pre>
<code class="lang-matlab">
%% access the prediction form the first detection 
predicitons = dldetections(1).annotations.dlclassification(j).predictions;
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>The loaded detections can then be plotted by accessing the
		waveform data in each structure;</p>
	<pre>
<code class="lang-matlab">
% plot all the spectrograms.
clf
tiledlayout(5,5)
for i=1:length(dldetections)
    
    nexttile
    
    % generate the data for a spectrgram
    [s, w, t] = spectrogram(dldetections(i).wave,512, 384,[],sR,'yaxis');
    
    % create the time and frequency matrices required to plot a surface 
    [X, Y] = meshgrid(t,w);
    % plot the surface (divide and multiply by 1000 to show milliseconds and kHz respectively)
    surf(X*1000, Y/1000, 20*log10(abs(s))-140, 'EdgeColor', 'None')
    view([0,90])
 
    caxis([70, 140]-140)  
    ylim([0,0.5]); 
    xlabel('')
    ylabel('')
    
    if (mod(i,5)==0)
       c = colorbar;  
       c.Label.String = 'Amplitude (dB)'; 
    end
 
    %x axis only on bottom plots
    if (i>=20)
       xlabel('Time (ms)') 
    end
    
    %y axis only on left most plots
    if (mod(i-1,5)==0)
       ylabel('Frequency (kHz)') 
    end
 end

	<h3 id="r">R</h3>
	<p>In the same way as MATLAB export, the PAMGuard time base display
		and export selected data units directly to an R struct which can be
		imported easily into R..</p>
	<p>
		R also has a well supported PAMGuard library with like for like
		functions compared to the MATLAB library. The PAMBinaries R library
		can be found <a href="https://github.com/TaikiSan21/PamBinaries">here</a>.
