	<h1>Level Meters</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>This module displays level meters for the audio signals in the side panel of the main PAMGuard GUI. </p>
	<p>This can be useful in diagnosing that all input channels are active and that none are saturating. </p>

	<h3>Creating the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the <em><strong>File>Add modules>Displays</strong></em>
		menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select "<em><strong>Level Meters</strong></em>". 
		Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Configuring the module</h3>
	<p>
		To configure the module, open the settings dialog from the <em><strong>Detection>"your
				module name" </strong></em> menu:

	<br>
	<p>In the dialog select the sound source (generally the sound acquisition module, but you could connect to the output 
	of some other process such as a filter or decimator).</p>
	<p>You can also chose whether to display levels as peak, or RMS. Peak is better for diagnosing saturation problems. </p>
	<p>It's also possible to select to display the data relative to full scale of the input device, in volts (input to the acquisition
	module) or in micropascals. </p>
	<p>The level meters will show as a small display in the PAMGuard side panel.</p>

	<p>You can adjust the position of the display in the side panel which 
	can be done by changing the order of the modules from the File>Module Ordering menu command.
