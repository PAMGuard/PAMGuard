<h1>Spectrogram Display</h1>
<h2>Configuring a Spectrogram display</h2>
<p><br>
  Spectrogram display options are specified when the display 
  is first created; in addition, they can be adjusted at any time using the popup 
  menu accessed by right clicking on the spectrogram plot and selecting <strong><em>&gt;Settings</em></strong>…. </p>
<p>
The Spectrogram Display Parameters Dialog has four tabs

<p>
<h3>Data Source Tab</h3>

<p>
Select the desired FFT Data source. 
The spectrogram display requires a source of FFT data which will 
generally come from a FFT (Spectrogram) Engine PAMGUARD module. 
<p>
Each spectrogram window can have any number of separate spectrogram 
panels which will share the top section of the display. All display 
panels will use data from the same FFT data source, but any 
combination of channels from that data source is permitted. 
<p>For example, 
  you may want to display each channel of data in a separate panel, so that 
  all data on all channels can be viewed. On the other hand, you may want 
  to display the same channel of data multiple times and overlay different 
  detector data on each panel. 
<p>
First set the number of panels required. The appropriate number of drop down lists, 
each offering a list of available channels will then change to reflect 
the number of panels. 


<p>
<h3>Scales Tab</h3>

<p>
Set the<strong> Frequency Range</strong>; for the vertical axis. 
  The default buttons will set these to range between 0 and to half the 
  sampling frequency of the selected data source.

<p>Set the <strong>Amplitude Rang;</strong>. For for  a greyscale display min will be the amplitude value coding for white and the maximum will be the value coding for black.
<p>Set the <strong>Time Range;</strong> this can either specify the number of 
pixels to display each bin of FFT data, or the length of time for the whole 
display (which may lead to a varying number of FFT partitions being 
displayed on each screen pixel). 
<p>A fixed number of pixels per FFT is the most efficient


setting.<p>
<h3>Plug ins Tab</h3>
<img alt="Spectrogram plug ins tab" src="./images/SpectrogramPlugins.png"/><br><br>
<p>Select he plug in display panels for the bottom section of the spectrogram window. 
The list of available plug-ins will depend on which detectors are available in 
the current PAMGUARD configuration.

<p>
<h3>Mark Observers Tab</h3>
<img alt="Spectrogram mark observers tab" src="./images/SpectrogramMarkObservers.png"/><br><br>
<p><strong>Mark Observers</strong> are PAMGUARD modules that receive information from the computer 
mouse when it is dragged across the Spectrogram display. The list of mark observers 
will depend on which modules are available in the current PAMGUARD configuration. 
Tick the check box for any modules that you wish to receive mouse movement 
information. 
<p>If one or more Mark Observers are selected, a red rectangle will appear on the 
spectrogram display panels when you press and drag the mouse across them. See the 
help documentation for the individual mark observers to see how they will use this 
information.
