	<h1>Spectrogram Display</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<h3>What is a spectrogram</h3>
	<p>A spectrogram is a graphical representation of sound, showing
		amplitude against time and frequency. Most often, time is shown on the
		x axis, frequency on the y axis, and amplitude is shown in
		greyscale, or colour.</p>
	<p>The PAMGuard spectrogram uses output from the <a href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">FFT (Spectrogram) engine</a>
	module, which in turn requires raw data from an <a href="../../../sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">Sound Acquisition module</a>, 
	<a href="../../../sound_processing/decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">Decimator module</a>, or some other producer of raw data in PAMGuard. </p>
	
	
	<h3>The PAMGuard spectrogram display</h3>
	<p>
		<br> Spectrogram windows not only display spectrograms, but they
		can also form a container for plug in graphics modules for detector
		data that is to be displayed beneath the spectrogram windows or in the
		case of the whistle detector, on top of it.
	</p>

		<br>
	<p>Each spectrogram display contains two main section divided by a
		movable divider that can be used to alter the size of each section.
	<p>Each section may be divided into several sub-displays.
	<p>The top section (which always exists) displays a number of
		spectrogram windows with optional graphic overlays from some PAMGuard
		detectors
	<p>The bottom section (which is optional) displays plug in displays
		from other parts of the PAMGuard system for showing data such as
		waveforms, detector output, trigger functions, etc. Data shown in the
		plug in panels will scroll in synchrony of the spectrogram data in the
		top section.
	<p>The types of plug in panels available will depend on the current
		PAMGuard configuration.
