<h1>Group 3D Localiser</h1>

<h2>Hyperbolic Algorithm</h2>
<p>The hyperbolic localisation algorithm is a direct implementation of the algorithm described in 
Gillette and Silverman (2008), although the algorithm was earlier described
by Spiesberger and Fristrup (1990). It's also worth reading Spiesberger (2001) which gives an 
explanation of the minimum number of hydrophones required for 2D and 3D localisation.</p>
<p>PAMGuard contains both 2D and 3D implementations of the algorithm and will automatically select
the appropriate version depending on the shape of the hydrophone array.</p> 
<p>A hyperbola is calculated for each pair of hydrophones from the time delay between that hydrophone 
pair. This requires that accurate time delays can be calculated for the sounds being detected, so 
accurate time synchronisation for all hydrophones is important. This is generally not  a problem for 
hydrophones cabled to a single acquisition system, but can be highly problematic for  


<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>To configure, select Hyperbolic from the list of available algorithms. Timing and channel configuration options will be shown. </p>

<p>It is possible to set a minimum correlation value for each time delay, any hydrophone pair with a cross correlation value smaller than
this being excluded from the minimisation function.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is also possible to set a minimum number of TOAD measurements to use in the localisation, the localisation attempt
being aborted if not enough hydrophone pairs can return adequate correlations between signals.</p>
<p>If hydrophones are arranged in groups (e.g. a click detector operating on multiple small hydrophone clusters as in 
Gillespie et al, (2020) then you can also define a minimum number of groups to use in a localisation.</p>
<p>If the detection source has TDOA timing options available, then these can be accessed through the Timing Settings button.</p>
