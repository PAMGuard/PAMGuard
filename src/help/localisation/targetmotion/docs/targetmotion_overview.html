<h1>Target Motion</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>

<body>

	<p>Target motion localisation is used to detect and localise
		continuously vocalising cetaceans, usually clicking odontocetes. The
		process requires a moving hydrophone array, usually towed by a vessel
		and makes the assumptions that during a train of detected clicks the
		acoustic source is stationary.</p>
	<p>
		These help pages concern themselves mostly with <a
			href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/offline_Overview.html">offline
			analysis</a> of data using the <a
			href="../../../overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">PAMGuard
			viewer</a>. Those interested in real time / online tracking using the
		PAMGuard click detector should refer to the <a

			Detector</a> section of the help.
	</p>
	<p>A towed array will detect a series of different clicks as it
		moves through the water. The path of the array, often referred to as
		the trackline, can be estimated by GPS units, accelerometers,
		gyroscopes and/or heading sensors. If the source is assumed to be
		stationary then each detected click corresponds to a set of time
		delays at some position along the trackline. Each set of time delays
		can be visualised as a 2D or 3D bearing, depending on the towed array,
		pointing towards the acoustic source. As more clicks are detected more
		bearings are calculated along the trackline and eventually they should
		begin to cross around the likely location of the source.</p>

	<p>Figure 1 shows an example of target motion data using a single
		array of two hydrophones. Each detected click corresponds to a time
		delay which restricts the source location to a hyperboloid surface.
		Because the hydrophones are relatively close together this surface can
		be approximated as a cone and for simplicity Figure 1 represents this
		cone in 2D as a green and red bearing line. As the track line
		progresses more clicks are detected and a possible source location can
		be calculated. Figure 1 shows two possible source locations, where the
		red lines cross and where the green lines cross. Errors in the
		location of the array and the obviously incorrect assumption that the
		vocalising cetacean remains stationary means that the bearings will
		rarely cross at a single point. In the case of a paired array with a
		completely straight trackline this will always give two possible
		locations in 2D and a perfect circle of possible locations in 3D.</p>
	<p>
		However there is often information which can be used to minimise these
		errors. The trackline is rarely straight. It 'wobbles' constantly and
		therefore breaks the symmetry which results in the circular
		distribution of possible locations. This is evident in Figure 1 one
		were the green bearings appear to cross through a more consistent
		point compared the red bearings. The more the trackline deviates from
		a straight line the more the ambiguity in position begins to break
		down. Figure 2 shows a 3D localisation attempt of Figure 1 assuming a
		relatively high uncertainty in the position of the array. <br>

	</table>

	<p>
		Here the high uncertainty in the position of array masks the small
		wobble in the trackline and so a circular probability distribution
		results. Note the cetacean is unlikely to be located above the sea
		surface so a large chunk of this circular distribution can be
		disregarded. <br> <br>If the uncertainty in the position of
		the array is reduced a different probability distribution results. <br>
	</p>
	<br>

	<table class="image" align="center" border="0">
		<caption align="bottom">

		</caption>
		<tr>

				src="images/TargetMotionPaired2.png" /></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>Figure 3 shows the probability distribution calculated from ther
		same data as in Figure 2 but assuming an almost perfect knowledge of
		the array position corresponding to the path of the trackline. Here
		the wobble in the trackline has resulted in a much tighter probability
		distribution with the most likely location of the cetacean being
		almost directly beneath the array.</p>
	<p>Localisation results are therefore a combined product of the
		expected uncertainties in measurements, the design of the towed array
		and the degree to which the trackline deviates from a straight line.
		PAMGUARD features multiple localisation algorithms which take all
		these factors into account.</p>
