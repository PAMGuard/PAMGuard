<h2>Detect Porpoises</h2>
<h3>
Summary
<NAME="Summary">
</h3>

<p><i>Process
10 channel .wav files using the click detector to detect porpoises and create
binary files</i></p>

<h3>
1.1 Create the Module Structure
<NAME="CreatetheModuleStructure">
</h3>

<p>To begin we
need to analyse the raw .wav data in PAMGuard. Start PAMGuard in <b><i>normal
mode. </i></b>Select<b><i> File > Add Modules > Sound Processing > Sound
Acquisition </i></b>to add the sound acquisition module. This will allow the
raw .wav files to be analysed in PAMGuard. Next we need a click detector. Go to
<b><i>File > Add Modules > Detector > Click Detector. </i></b>The click
detector module should now appear. Finally we need a database (<b><i>File > Add
Modules > Utilities > Database</i></b>) and binary storage (<b><i>File > Add
Modules > Utilities > Binary Store</i></b>).</p>

<p>Now you have
added the modules the next stage is to set up everything. Your data model
should look like. </p>

<p>Figure 1 The data model should look roughly like this to analyse clicks.</p>
</center>

<p>In PAMGuard
you always move from modules on the left to modules on the right when inputting
settings. So here we start with sound acquisition and then move to the click
detector. <b><i>Select Detection > Sound Acquisition... </i></b>In the dialog
box set the audio source to <b><i>Audio file or multiple file, </i></b>select <b><i>Select
Folder or Files...</i></b> and choose the folder containing the porpoise .wav
files. Now that the sound acquisition knows you are dealing with ten channels
of data you will need to create a ten channel hydrophone array in the array
manager. Go to <b><i>File > Hydrophone Array...</i></b> and use <b><i>Import.</i></b>
to select the ten channel array file for this porpoise data. (In Exercise 1-2
folder) The hydrophone array manager dialog box should look like.</p>

<h3>
1.2 Set
up the Click Detector Params
<NAME="SetuptheClickDetectorParams">
</h3>

<p>Now set up
the click detector. Go to the <b><i>Click Detection</i></b> menu on the main
screen and select <b><i>Detection Parameters...</i></b>. We want to detect clicks
on all channels so select the check box for all ten channels. Make sure that
no grouping is selected. This is usually sensible for wide aperture arrays (see
note). Select the <b><i>Trigger</i></b> tab and ensure check boxes are selected
for every channel. This ensures each channel individually runs the click detection
algorithm. Click <b><i>OK.</i></b></p>

<h3>
1.3 Create filters to optimise for Porpoise Click Detection
<NAME="CreatefilterstooptimiseforPorpoiseClickDetection">
</h3>

<p>Now we want
to set up filters to optimise our chances of finding porpoise clicks. There are
two filters in the click detector, a pre filter and digital trigger filter. The
pre filter filters the raw sound data used by the click detector module. We
want to get rid of low frequency noise so a high pass filter at 20kHz is ideal.
Select <b><i>Click Detection > Digital Pre Filter...</i></b> In the dialog
which pops up create a high pass Butterworth filter at 20000Hz.</p>

<center>
<p><img width=456 height=319 id="Picture 8" src="images/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>Figure 4. The digital pre filter should be set to 20kHz, high pass. </p>
</center>

<p>Now we need
to set the digital trigger filter. The digital trigger filter is only used by
the algorithm which searches for clicks. The final saved click waveforms and
spectra are taken from the raw sound data filtered only by the pre filter.
Since porpoises have narrow band high frequency clicks it is sensible to search
for clicks only in a narrow frequency band. Hence our digital trigger filter
will be a band pass, from 100kHz to 150kHz. Select <b><i>Click Detection > 
Digital trigger filter...</i></b> In the dialog which pops up create a band pass
Chebyshev filter between 100000 and 150000Hz. </p>

<h3>
1.4 Create
a porpoise click classifier
<NAME="Createaporpoiseclickclassifier">
</h3>

<p>The click
detector is now set up to detect clicks in the porpoise frequency range.
However, although we have optimised the click detector for porpoise like
vocalisations it will still detect many different types of sounds. In order to
determine whether porpoise are present we need to classify clicks. For this we
can use the PAMGuard click classifier. Go to <b><i>Click Detection > Click
Classification</i>. </b>In the <b><i>Click Classifier Selection</i></b> drop
down box select<b><i> Classifier with frequency sweep. </i></b>Select<b><i> New
</i></b>to bring up a new click classifier settings dialog. In the bottom of
the dialog box use the <b><i>Set Defaults </i></b>button to create default
porpoise parameters. Click OK. </p>

<p>Figure 6. The click classifier has default settings for porpoise clicks. </p>

<p>You've now
created a porpoise click classifier. To ensure that classifier is applied to
data make sure that the <b><i>Run classification online</i></b> and <b><i>Enable</i></b>
check boxes are selected.</p>

<h3>
1.5 Running
<NAME="Running">
</h3>


<p>We have now
set the detector click detector up to detect and classifiy porpoise
vocalisations. To run select <b><i>Detection > Start</i></b></p>

<p>Figure 8. The click detector running through the ten
channel .wav files should look something like the above. </p>

<p><b><i>A note
on groups.</i></b><i> In
many detectors you have the option of "grouping channels". Grouping tells
PAMGuard to automatically calculate extra information for those channels which
have been selected as belonging to a group. Grouped channels are saved as a
single data unit containing information from each channel. For example, a towed
array contains two closely spaced hydrophones. These two channels, when
analysed in PAMGuard, are usually grouped. If a click is detected on one of the
hydrophones then a waveform clip is also automatically recorded from the other
channel; this is then saved as a data unit containing information on both
channels. PAMGuard can calculate extra information for any data unit which
contains more than channel of information. For our towed array, two clicks allow
bearing information to be calculated for bearing time displays and target
motion analysis. In general widely spaced hydrophones are not grouped.</i></p>
