Summary
<NAME="Summary">
</h3>

<p><i>Open
PAMGUARD binary files in viewer mode, browse through clicks and create a better
porpoise click classifier. Re-classify porpoise clicks with the better
classifier in viewer mode, mark out interesting click features and view using
concatenated spectrogram. </i></p>

<p>You have so
far used PAMGUARD to run through ten channels of raw .wav data and pick out
porpoise clicks. All clicks, including classified porpoise clicks, have been
saved in PAMGUARD binary files. These are around 99.9% smaller than .wav files
and contain all information needed to browse through click data and perform
complex tasks, such as classification or localisation. In this exercise we will
open binary files in PAMGUARD viewer mode. </p>

<p>Start
PAMGUARD viewer mode. PAMGUARD will ask you to select a database. Select the
database you used in analysing the .wav files. Next PAMGUARD will ask you to
select binary files. </p>

<p>Figure 9. Open the binary files you saved.</p>
</center>
<p>Select the
folder you saved binary files when using PAMGUARD in standard mode. PAMGUARD
should now open. You will be presented with a click detector window which looks
very similar to PAMGUARD in standard mode. </p>
<center>
<p><img width=306 height=316

alt="Extra scroll bar controls are present in many primary displays in PAMGUARD viewer mode. Only a certain time period of click detections will be loaded into the computer's memory at any one time. Only these detections are visible in the click detector display. To move to time period before or after the current data loaded data press the blue buttons. The middle button can be pressed to bring up a dialog box. Here you can define the period of data (Duration) to be loaded into memory. The Step Size defines the 'jump' to take to the next section of data. For example 75% means, when a new section of data is loaded, 25% of the previous section is left. The Start Time allows you to manually select where to load the data from."></p>
</center>

<p>There are,
however, several important differences between the click detector in PAMGAURD
viewer and standard mode. The scroll bars allow users to navigate through and
load new sections of data. You will also find new displays are present and
extra functionality exists to annotate clicks and add to events. Play around
with the controls and load a new section of clicks. </p>

<h3>
2.1
Reclassify clicks
<NAME="Reclassifyclicks">
</h3>

<p>You will
notice after selecting some click detections, that the classifier we used in
section 1 has missed a lot of porpoise clicks. For the purposes of
localisation it is often better to have more false positives than false
negatives. Therefore we need to reclassify clicks. Go to <b><i>Click
Detection > Re Analyse Click Types... </i></b>This will bring up the click
analysis dialog box.</p>
<center>
<p><img width=260 height=359
id="Picture 17" src="images/image018.png"></p>

<p>Figure 10. Reprocessing clicks allows you to tweak classifier settings. </p>
</center>
<p>Tick the <b><i>Reclassify
Clicks </i></b>check box and click on <b><i>Settings... </i></b>This will bring
up the familiar click classifier manager from which you can access your
classifier settings. </p>
<center>
<p>

<img width=216 height=182 id="Picture 18" src="images/image021.jpg"></p>
</center>


<p>In the click
classifier disable the <b><i>Click Length</i></b> and <b><i>Zero Crossing </i></b>settings.
Click OK on the classifier and Classifier manager to return the <b><i>Click
Analysis dialog</i></b>. In the <b><i>Data Options</i></b> drop down menu
select <b><i>All Data. </i></b>This will perform data processing on<b><i> </i></b>all
binary files rather than just the click detections currently loaded into
memory. Click <b><i>Start</i></b> and wait for the processing to finish.</p>


<p>You should
notice that the number of classified clicks visibly increases. Play around with
the classifier until you are happy with the settings and the majority of the
porpoise clicks are correctly classified. </p>

2.2
Create an Event
<NAME="CreateanEvent">
</h3>

<p>The PAMGUARD Viewer click detector
allows manual marking of events. Events usually consist of a group of clicks
associated with one acoustic encounter of a particular species. Event
information is saved to the database and in certain situations can be used to
perform extra analysis</p>

<p>Double click on the amplitude time
display. By repeatedly clicking with the mouse you can draw a bounding line
around a group of clicks. By joining up the ends of the dotted line an area is
selected and will be coloured grey.</p>

<center>
<p><img width=602 height=323 id="Picture 25" src="images/image023.jpg"></p>

<p>Figure 11. You can select groups of clicks to add to an
event by drawing a shape around them and right clicking.</p>
</center>

<p>These clicks
can now be saved as an event. Right click within the grey area and select <b><i>New
Event</i></b>. Use <b><i>Porpoise</i></b> from the drop down menu and click <b><i>OK</i></b>.
If there are no species in the dropdown menu you can right click and select <b><i>Edit
Species</i></b> to add some. Your clicks should now turn a different colour
which indicates this event is saved. By selecting <b><i>Click Detection > Show Events</i></b>you can bring up a dialog box showing
selected events. </p>

<center>
<p><img width=438 height=282 id="Picture 26" src="images/image024.jpg" alt=events></p>

<p>Figure 12. Events can be accessed from the Event List. </p>
</center>

<p>Create a few events of interesting sections of clicks. </p>

<h3>
2.3 View events on extra displays
<NAME="Vieweventsonextradisplays">
</h3>

<p>There are a
few extra displays in viewer mode which allow users to investigate more acoustic
properties of clicks, especially once events have been selected. </p>

<p>Go to <b><i>Click Display > Add Display... > Concatenated Spectrogram.</i></b> This will add
the Concatenated Spectrogram display. Click on a click within an event to bring
up the concatenated spectrogram for that event. You should see a narrow band
of energy near 130kHz, typical for porpoise vocalisations.</p>

clicks. As expected lots of energy in the 120-140kHz band. </p>
