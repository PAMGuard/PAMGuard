	<h2>Using the DIFARGram Display</h2>

	<p>When DIFAR clips are processed&nbsp;from the DIFAR queue, they
		are&nbsp;sent to the DIFAR Localisation display where they&nbsp;are
		first demultiplexed in order to separate out the signals from the
		three acoustic&nbsp;sensors. Depending on the bandwidth and frequency
		resolution, demultiplexing may takes several seconds to perform on a
		typical 10 &ndash; 30s long clip, longer on slow computers. Progress
		is shown in the top right of the DIFAR Localisation display.</p>

	<p>The Greeneridge demultiplexer has an inherent mechanism for
		determining whether a signal contains a correctly multiplexed DIFAR
		signal.&nbsp;Correct demodulation can only be achieved when
		the&nbsp;Greeneridge demultiplexer correctly locks onto the&nbsp;7.5
		and 15kHz carrier signals. The lock status is also shown in the
		progress bar, which will be red if the signal is not locked. If the
		signal doesn't lock, then the clip should be discarded. NB: The AMMC
		demultiplexer does not presently contain any mechanism for determining
		whether a clip contains a correctly multiplexed DIFAR signal,
		thus&nbsp;when using the AMMC demultiplexer user experience and
		investigation of the directional signals may be required to determine
		whether the results of demodulation are sensible.</p>

	<p>The display shows the spectrogram of the processed&nbsp;clip on
		the left&nbsp;with the DIFARGram on the right. By default, the
		spectrogram is created from the decimated raw input data (i.e. the
		omnidirectional hydrophone). Right clicking on the spectrogram allows
		the operator to display the signals from any of the three
		demultiplexed signals (i.e. omnidirectional, north-south, and
		east-west directional signals).</p>

	<p>
		The DIFARGram is a colourmap of energy verses frequency and angle.
		There should be intense colour at the frequency of the selected sound
		and also at the angle from which the sound has arrived. To guide the
		eye a summary line is also displayed which shows the DIFARGram summed
		between the frequency limits of the clip. The summary line may be
		turned on and off by right clicking on the DIFARGram. The&nbsp;angle
		and frequency&nbsp;corresponding to&nbsp;the maximum energy are
		selected by default, and their values&nbsp;are&nbsp;shown&nbsp;as the
		<strong>Selection</strong> in the&nbsp;<strong>Info</strong>&nbsp;panel
		next to the DIFARGram.
	</p>

	<p>
		At this time, the bearing calculated for the clip&nbsp;will be
		displayed on the <a href="../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html">PAMGuard
			map</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Buttons and Actions</h3>

	<p>
		If the operator is happy with the selected maximum, they can simply
		press the <strong>Save</strong> button. If The <strong>Auto</strong>
		button is selected, the clip will save automatically after a short
		delay. Alternately the operator can click anywhere on the DIFARGram to
		select a different angle and frequency (in which case the bearing
		displayed on the map will immediately update).
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Delete</strong> will permanently delete the clip. The clip can
		also be returned to the DIFAR queue by right clicking anywhere on the
		DIFARGram and selecting the appropriate menu item.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <strong>Zoom Freq</strong> button causes both the spectrogram
		display and the DIFARGram to zoom in in frequency to slightly more
		than the frequency limits of the selected sound.
