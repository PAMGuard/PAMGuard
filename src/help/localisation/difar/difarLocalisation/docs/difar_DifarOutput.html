<h1>
DIFAR Localisation
</h1>

<h2>
Output from the DIFAR System
</h2>

<p>
DIFAR results are stored in both the
<a href="../../../utilities/generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html">PAMGaurd database</a>
and in the
<a href="../../../utilities/BinaryStore/docs/binarystore_overview.html">Binary storage system</a>
. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages so it is likely that you will want to use both. 
</p>
<p>
The database can store a single line of information for each localisation in a format
which can be easily read using a database management system (e.g MS Access). However,
the database is unable to store the full waveform clip. 
</p>
<p>
The binary store stores data in a system which can only be read by the PAMGuard software.
However, it is able to store the waveform clip for each DIFAR localisation allowing the
operator to review data offline using the PAMGuard viewer.
