<h1>DIFAR Localisation</h1>

<h2>Graphics Output</h2>

<p>As well as the DIFAR queue and the DIFAR localisation display, the DIFAR system can overlay data on both the spectrogram and the <a href="../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html">PAMGuard map</a>. Data from the DIFAR Queue and the Processed clips will automatically be included in lists of possible overlays for both these displays. Additional options are also available from the Display / DIFAR Localisation Display options menu.</p>

<p>Default length: This is the default length of lines drawn on the map. Amplitude scaling is in use If multiple buoys are in use and a crossing point has been calculated, then this value is ignored and lines are drawn as far as the crossing point.</p>

<p>Amplitude Scaling: If &lsquo;Amplitude scaled line length&rsquo; is selected, then a range is estimated based on a nominal source level, the received level, and the geometric spreading model of the form <img alt=" r = 10^((SL-RL)/g) " src="./images/SpreadingRule.png" /> where g is the geometric spreading factor.</p>

<p>Fade bearings: If the fade bearings button is selected, then lines drawn on the map will fade from solid to transparent over the set time period.</p>

<p>Show Vessels. If this is selected, bearings to vessels will be displayed as well as bearings to other sounds.</p>
