	<h1>DIFAR Localisation</h1>

	<h2>Using the Spectrogram</h2>

	<p>The spectrogram display serves&nbsp;several purposes. Firstly it
		provides a visual check that the DIFAR signal is being received
		correctly. Secondly it allows the operator to manually mark out sounds
		they want to be processed with the DIFAR system. Lastly, it provides
		visual indication of the detections and classifications that&nbsp;are
		in the DIFAR Queue and/or have been processed.</p>

	<p>The figure shows a typical spectrogram display using&nbsp;one
		DIFAR sensors. The spectrogram is displaying the low frequency FFT
		data, with a bandwidth of 0 to 125 Hz. The lower panel is showing the
		instantaneous spectra from the 48kHz data. In this lower panel clear
		spectral peaks are visible at 7.5kHz and at 15kHz. These are the
		carrier frequencies for the frequency modulated signal from the DIFAR
		buoy. If these peaks are not clearly visible, then it's likely
		that&nbsp;the DIFAR buoy is out of range or there is a problem with
		your receiving system.</p>

	<p>There are also&nbsp;broader 'humps' in the bottom panel
		which represent the multiplexed signals from&nbsp;the three
		acoustic&nbsp;sensors. The hump between 0 and about 4 kHz is the
		spectrum of data received on the omnidirectional hydrophone. This is
		broadly similar in shape to the humps either side of the 15kHz carrier
		which are the signals on the two directional sensors.</p>

	<p>To mark a sound simply place the mouse on the spectrogram at the
		start of a sound and drag to the end of a sound. While you are
		dragging, other marks on the spectrogram will temporarily disappear.
		While dragging, the mark will also appear on every channel, although
		only the channel you are marking will be used in DIFAR processing.</p>

	<p>
		If marks do not appear on the spectrogram display the most likely
		cause is that the <a
			href="./difar_configureUserDisplay.html#Thespectrogram">mark
			observers</a> on the spectrogram display have not been correctly
		configured. Once a sound has been marked on the spectrogram it will be
		sent to the DIFAR queue.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the spectrogram itself,&nbsp;sounds that are in the DIFAR Queue
		will be&nbsp;indicated with a black rectangle with a dashed
		line&nbsp;corresponding to the mark. Sounds that have been assigned a
		<a href="./difar_ConfigureProcessing.html#Species">classification</a>
		will appear as coloured marks corresponding to the colour assigned to
		that <a href="./difar_ConfigureProcessing.html#Species">classification</a>.
		A solid line around a clip indicates that those sounds that have been
		processed and saved and are no longer in the DIFAR Queue.
	</p>

	<h3>DIFAR Side-panel</h3>

	<p>
		The <em>DIFAR Selection</em> side-panel can be used to&nbsp;combine
		the process of&nbsp;manually marking of sounds and assigning
		classifications. When the <em>Assign classification</em>&nbsp;checkbox
		is checked, the highlighted classification will be automatically
		applied to newly created clips. When combined with the option to <em>Auto-process
			classified clips, </em>this will further streamline operation and reduce
		the need to interact with the DIFAR queue. This mode of operation is
		especially streamlined when there are only a few different
		classifications are present in a recording.
	</p>

	<p>
		When checked, the&nbsp;<em>Multi-Channel</em> checkbox will apply
		classifications and create individual DIFAR clips from&nbsp;each of
		the audio channels&nbsp;in a given Raw Data source. When unchecked
		(the default option), a clip will be created only for the marked
		channel. <em>Multi-Channel</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;typically the
		most&nbsp;useful&nbsp;when&nbsp;sonobuoys have been deployed very
		close to each-other.&nbsp;
