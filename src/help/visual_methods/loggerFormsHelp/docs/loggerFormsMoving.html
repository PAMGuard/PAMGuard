<h1>Logger Forms</h1>

<h2>Moving to a New Database</h2>

<p>It is highly likely that at some point, you'll want to move your logger forms to a new database. 
To do this, you will need to copy across all of your UDF_ tables, and also your Lookup table. </p>
<p>Do NOT export the tables as CSV or other text files, or they will lose important format information. 
Instead, open both your old and your new database and copy the tables across using the database
software. </p>
<p>If you're using and sqlite database and 
<a href="https://sqlitestudio.pl/">SQLite Studio</a> software, then this is straightforward using mouse driven copy-paste operations, so 
long as both databases are open in the same instance of SQLite Studio.</p>
