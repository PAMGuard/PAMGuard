<h1>Video Range</h1>
<h2>Calibration</h2>
<p>A calibration factor is required to allow distances measured on
the image (in pixels) to be converted into angles subtended at the lens
and a new a factor will be needed for each camera / zoom combination.</p>
<p>Calculation of a calibration factor using PAMGuard involves
making measurements between points on a perpendicular image of an object
of known size taken at a known range, with the camera and zoom setting
to be used for later range measurements.</p>
<p>To open the image press either the <strong>Paste</strong> or <strong>File</strong>
buttons under <strong>Image</strong> in the control panel as appropriate
(depending on whether the image has bee stored as a file or on the
clipboard.)</p>
<p>Use the cursor to mark two known points on the object.</p>
<p>A dialogue opens prompting for the distance between these points
(in cm) and the range from the camera to the object (in m). Provide a
sensible name for the calibration factor (e.g. &quot;Full Zoom&quot;)
and store it.</p>

<p><em>In the image above the distance between two white bands
50cm apart on a pole placed 46m from the camera have been marked. The
calibrations factor will be stored with the name &quot;Full Zoom&quot;.</em></p>
<p>This calibration factor will now be available to be chosen for
future analysis of any images taken with these camera settings.<br>
