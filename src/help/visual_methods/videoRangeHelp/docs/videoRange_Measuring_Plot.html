<h1>Video Range</h1>
<h2>Range Measurement Plotting</h2>
<p>To measure range to an object shown in an image the operator must
plot two points on the horizon (or shoreline) and a point at the
waterline of the object itself.</p>
<p>Using the side panel,<strong> Load</strong> the image to be
analysed from a file or the clipboard as appropriate.</p>
<p>Plot the required points using the cursor, staring with two
points to define the horizon. For accuracy, these should be widely
spaced. (To replot the horizon for example if an eror has been made
click<strong> Clear Horizon</strong> on the side panel.)</p>
<p>Plot a point on the waterline of the object and a dialogue will
open showing the calculated range.</p>
<p>Press reject if an error in plotting has been made (the dialogue
will clear and you will be able to plot the object again). Otherwise,
add a note to be stored in the database with the range data and press
accept.</p>
<p>Additional objects in the same frame can now be plotted using the
same horizon line. In the image below for example the location of both a
boat and a beaked whale have been plotted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/plot.jpg" alt="range plot" /></p>
<p><em>The figure above shows an example of an image taken from
a shore station showing a beaked whale close to a vessel. The location
of both the vessel and the whale have been plotted.</em></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>If <strong>Bearings </strong>have been obtained manually (e.g.
from a bearing ring or compass) then they should be entered as true
bearings in the box in the bar at the top of the display window. The
incremental angle for each point plotted within the image is calculated
and added to the bearing angle.</p>
<p>PAMGuard includes modules for measuring bearings automatically
and help on these can be found here

Measurement</a></p>
<p>Settings will remain in place unless changed. To analyse
additional images with the same settings simply <strong>Load </strong>the
new image.</p>
