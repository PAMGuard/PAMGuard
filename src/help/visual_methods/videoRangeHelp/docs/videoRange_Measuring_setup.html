<h1>Video Range</h1>
<h2>Range Measurement Setup</h2>
<p>To measure a range from an image choose a previously entered
Height in the <strong>Height</strong> drop down dialogue.</p>
<p>If an appropriate height has not be set then press <em><strong>Settings&gt;Heights&gt;
Add</strong></em></p>
<p>Enter the camera height above sea level and give it a sensible
name</p>
<p><img src="images/Height.jpg" alt="Choose Height" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> tabs allow different choices of
calculation method to be chosen</p>
<p><img src="images/Calculation.jpg" alt="CalculationMethod" /></p>
<p>The &quot;Round Earth&quot; method is most straight forward and
quite adequate for closer objects.</p>
<p>The &quot;Refraction Method&quot; makes allowances for predicted
refraction conditions based on the prevailing temperature, temperature
gradient and atmospheric pressure. Values for these must be added in the
appropriate fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final choice, under <strong>Analysis</strong>, is between
Measuring from the Horizon and Measuring from the Shore.</p>
<p>Measuring from the shore line is an advanced option to be used
when a shore line and no horizon is visible behind the object of
interest. Details of how to use this option are found here. <a
