<h1>Video Range Measuring</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>

<p>The video range modules in PAMGuard are used to analyse grabbed
video images in order to measure the range to an object floating on the
water.</p>
<p>The principle of the method is very simple. The range to floating
objects at sea can be calculated from the angle of dip between the
horizon and the waterline of the object. Often this angle is estimated
using reticules in binoculars, but this is difficult and inaccurate,
especially when the subjects are small marine mammals that are only
fleetingly visible at the surface. However, the angle can be measured
accurately and at leisure from an image taken with a calibrated lens
from a known height.</p>
<p>images can be obtained using either still or video cameras. With
the advent of affordable higher definition video equipment HD camcorders
are usually the most effective means of obtaining the necessary images.
Some practical information on equipment and field procedures can be
found at http://www.ecologicuk.co.uk/</p>
<p>The method can also be applied from land stations (an application
for which theodolites are traditionally employed.) When used from land
station its necessary to configure PAMGuard with a fixed stationary
array. Instruction on setting up PAMGuard in this mode are found <a

<p>The methods implemented here are described in detail in Leaper,
R., and Gordon, J. 2001. Application of photogrammetric methods for
locating and tracking cetacean movements at sea. J. CETACEAN RES.
MANAGE. 3(2):131–141</p>
<p>The first step is to create an instance of a video range module
in PAMGuard</p>
