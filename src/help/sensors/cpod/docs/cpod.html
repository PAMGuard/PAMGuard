	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		CPODs and FPODs are click data loggers widely used in research and
		industry developed by <a href="https://www.chelonia.co.uk">Chelonia
			Ltd</a>. PAMGuard&#39;s CPOD module allows users to import CPOD <em>and</em>
		FPOD data into PAMGuard so it can be viewed using PAMGuard&#39;s
		visualisation tools. A common use case for this module is to display
		both CPOD/FPOD data and a lower frequency recording device together -
		for example a typical PAM setup is to use a CPOD to record high
		frequency echolocation clicks then a lower frequency recorder (e.g. 96
		kHz sample rate) to record dolphin whistles, noise, fish sounds etc.
	</p>
	<h2 id="quick-overview-of-cpod-fpod-data">Quick overview of
		CPOD/FPOD data</h2>
	<p>CPODs and FPODs do not record raw audio - they run a simple on
		board click detector and then save some basic metrics on each detected
		click e.g. peak frequency, bandwidth, end frequency etc. FPODs, the
		successor of CPODs, also record a little extra waveform data on a
		small subset of detected clicks. Once a CPOD or FPOD has been
		recovered, it is processed using CPOD.exe or FPOD.exe software
		respectively which runs a click train classifier. The click train
		classifier extracts sequences of successive clicks that are likely
		from the same source, e.g a dolphin, porpoise or echo sounder. It then
		assigns a likely species to a click train or classes it as unknown.
		The outputs from the click train detector are saved to a CP3 file
		which is essentially a file that contains only clicks that have been
		assigned to click trains.</p>
	<h2 id="adding-the-cpod-module">Adding the CPOD module</h2>
	<p>
		To add the CPOD module go to <strong><em>File-&gt;Add
				Modules-&gt;Sensors-&gt;CPOD</em></strong>. The module requires the binary storage
		module in PAMGuard <strong><em>File-&gt; Add
				modules-&gt;Utilities-&gt;Binary File</em></strong>. Once both the CPOD and Binary
		file storage modules have been added open the CPOD settings using <strong><em>Settings-&gt;CPOD
				importer</em></strong>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="importing-cpod-fpod-data">Importing CPOD/FPOD data</h2>
	<p>The module has three possible modes of importing data</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Import raw detection data i.e. CP1 or FP1 data. PAMGuard will
			display the CPOD detection but no click train ID data is available.</li>
		<li>Import just the click trains data i.e. CP3 or FP3 files -
			PAMGuard will only import clicks which are part of click trains</li>
		<li>Import both both raw and click train data (recommended).
			PAMGuard imports the raw detections then uses the click train data to
			assign detections to click trains.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Users can use the file button to select a single file (e.g. an FP3
		file) or the folder button to select a folder of CPOD/FPOD files. If
		the folder button is used and there are both CP1/FP1 (detections) and
		CP3/FP3 (click trains) files then PAMGuard will automatically load all
		files and assign detections to click trains. Once files have imported
		select <strong><em>Import</em></strong> and the data will be imported
		into PAMGuard - note this can take some time, especially if importing
		CP1/FP1 files.

		<em>The CPOD module allow users to import CPOD/FPOD data by
			selecting either individual files or a folder of files</em>
	</p>
	<h2 id="visualising-cpod-fpod-data">Visualising CPOD/FPOD data</h2>
	<p>A broad overview of CPOD data is shown in PAMGuard&#39;s data
		map which shows a datagram similar to the click detector. The datagram
		shows the frequency density of CPOD/FPOD clicks constructed from the
		peak frequency parameter for each click The datagram can be useful for
		quickly navigating to sections of data that may contain porpoises
		and/or dolphins.</p>
	<p>Individual CPOD detections can be viewed in the Time base
		display in PAMGuard. Add the CPOD module to a plot and then data can
		be viewed with time using a selection y-axis options such as
		Amplitude, Amplitude (stem), Frequency, bandwidth etc.</p>

		<em>FPOD data visualised in the time base display as a stem plots
			like FPOD.exe (top) and as a scatter plot of click amplitudes
			(bottom)</em>
	</p>
	<h2 id="data-selector">Data selector</h2>
	<p>The CPOD module has a custom data selector which provides a
		unified interface for users to select subsets of CPOD/FPOD data. The
		data selector has sliders which set the range of various parameters,
		such as peak frequency and also allows the selection of CPOD/FPOD
		which belong to a click and those gave been classified to a particular
		species. Users can use the data selector to, for example, only export
		clicks classified as dolphin or perhaps plot only clicks with a peak
		frequency between 100 and 150 kHz on the time display.</p>

	<h2 id="exporting-cpod-fpod-data">Exporting CPOD/FPOD data</h2>
	<p>CPOD and FPOD data can be exported to .RData and .mat using
		PAMGuard&#39;s exporter.</p>
	<p align="center">
		<img width="450" height="600"
			src="resources/cpod_exporter_dialog_swing.png">
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>PAMGuard&#39;s exporter can export CPOD/FPOD clicks to .mat
			or .RData files. These can be opened in MATLAB, Python, and R
			respectively</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		The fields saved by the exporter are the same as a standard PAMGuard
		detection <a href="../../overview/dataexport/docs/dataexport.html">(see
			exporter help)</a>. The additional fields for CPODs and FPODs are
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>bandwidth</em>: the bandwidth of the click in Hz</li>
		<li><em>numcycles</em>: the number of cycles fo the click in Hz</li>
		<li><em>peakfreq</em>: the peak frequency of the click in Hz</li>
		<li><em>endfreq</em>: the end frequency of the click in Hz</li>
		<li><em>SPL</em>: the CPOD measure of sound pressure level which
			is an integer between 0 and 255.</li>
		<li><em>slope</em>: the slope which is a parameter measured by the
			CPOD and FPOD.</li>
		<li><em>wave</em>: this will be empty for most clicks but some
			clicks from FPODs will have a waveform. Note that this is
			reconstructed from zero crossings and is NOT a clip from the raw
			sound data.</li>
		<li><em>species</em>: if the CPOD is part of a click train then
			species will be 0 for UNKNOWN, 1 for NBHF, 2 for DOLPHIN and 3 for
			SONAR. -1 indicates a click is not part of a click train.</li>
		<li><em>clicktrainID</em>: indicates the click train that the
			click belongs to. This can be cross referenced with UID column in the
			PAMGuard database which stores click trains and/or used to as an
			identifier to associate different clicks together into trains.</li>
	</ul>
