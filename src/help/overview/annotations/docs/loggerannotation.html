	<h1>Logger Form Annotation</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>
		Logger Form annotations can be used to design complex data entry forms
		with multiple input controls in which the user can enter additional
		data. For further details see the <a
			href="../../../visual_methods/loggerFormsHelp/docs/loggerFormsOverview.html">Help
			for Logger Forms</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Logger forms can be very simple, for instance containing a
		single drop down list of species for the user to select, or may have
		many dozens of different data entry fields.</p>
	<p>It is not necessary to add a Logger Forms module to PAMGuard in
		order to use Logger Forms as annotations.</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<h3>Configuring</h3>
	<p>
		Any module using Logger Forms annotations will offer a way of
		configuring those forms (see <a
			href="../../../localisation/detectiongroup/docs/dglocaliser.html">Detection
			Group Localiser</a> for an example). When you enter the configuration for
		the forms you will first be presented with a dialog allowing to select
		and existing form or to create a new one.

	<br>
	<p>One you have selected / created the form of your choice, you can
		edit the form by pressing the "Edit Form" button. This will display a
		dialog from the Logger Forms system which enables you to interactively
		add and remove controls from the form.</p>

	<p>Alternately you can directly edit the Logger UDF_ table in the
		database.</p>
	<p>
		See <a
			href="../../../visual_methods/loggerFormsHelp/docs/designingForms.html">Designing
			Logger Forms</a> for further information
	</p>

	<h3>Data entry</h3>
	<p>When required the form will appear on the screen. The user
		should enter data as required by the form and press Ok, or press
		Cancel if they do not wish to add any new data.</p>

	<h2>Stored Data</h2>
	<p>Logger form annotations will be appended as additional columns to the output database table
	for the data you're annotating, or will be written into the binary data. </p>
	<p>Multiple columns will be added to output database tables. One for
		each data entry field in the selected form.</p>
		<p>Note that an output table for the logger form will normally still be created, i.e. if 
		you made a logger annotation UDF_ table UDF_MyAnnot, then the table MyAnnot will appear
		in the database, but no data will be written to that table. </p>
