	<h1>Data Annotation</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	

	<p>PAMGuard contains many different types of detector, most of which have their own unique set of output data which get stored either
	in the Binary Store or in the Database.</p>
	<p>However, many types of data will have common measurements or manually entered comments associated with them. Since PAMGuard version 2.00.00
	these have been organised into <b>Data Annotations</b>.</p>
	<p>Annotations are built in as fixed parts of several PAMGuard modules, for example the
	<a href="../../../utilities/spectrogramannotations/docs/spectrogramannotations.html">Spectrogram Annotation</a> module, and the 
	<a href="../../../localisation/detectiongroup/docs/dglocaliser.html">Group Detection Localiser</a>.</p>
	 <p>Modules employing the user selectable annotations framework may only offer a subset of the full list of
	 annotations, depending on the compatibility of the annotation with the type of data generated by the module.</p> 
	<br>
	
	<h2>Annotation Data Storage</h2>
	<p>Most annotations are currently configured to save their data by adding additional  columns to pre-existing database tables storing the output of 
	particular modules in the <a href="../../../utilities/generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html">PAMGuard Database</a>.
	Future releases may also add annotation data to the <a href="../../../utilities/BinaryStore/docs/binarystore_overview.html">Binary data store.</a> </p>
	
	<h2>Data Annotation Types</h2>
	<h3>Sound Measurements</h3>
	<p>There are currently three annotation types which measure or act on sound data. These are:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>SNR Measurement. Measures Signal to Noise Ratio.</li>
	<li>SPL Measurement. Measures Sound Pressure Level.</li>
	<li>WAV File. Creates a WAV file clip.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>These are only currently used built into larger modules</p>
	
	<h3>User Input</h3>
	<p>There are two annotation types which invite the user to enter additional input to describe something they are observing on the PAMGuard Display. These are:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><a href="textannotation.html">Text Annotations.</a> Allows a simple line of text to be entered.</li>
	<li><a href="loggerannotation.html">User Form Annotations.</a> Allows the design and use of a more complex data entry form.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Localisation</h3>
	<p>There is currently a single annotation type which adds localisation information to data. This is:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><a href="targetmotionannotation.html">Target Motion Annotations.</a> .</li>
	</ol>
