	<h1>PAMGuard</h1>
	<h2>PAMGuard Viewer</h2>
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		The PAMGuard viewer can be used to view data stored in the <a
			href="../../../utilities/generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html">
			PAMGuard database</a> and the <a
			href="../../../utilities/BinaryStore/docs/binarystore_overview.html">binary
			storage system.</a>
	</p>
	<p>Some viewer operations, such as the spectrogram display also
		load and re-process small amounts of raw audio data from sound files
		(if available).</p>

	<h3>Starting PAMGuard Viewer</h3>
	<p>The PAMGuard viewer can be started from the shortcut to PAMGuard
		Viewer placed on your system when you installed PAMGuard.
	<p>
		If you are using one of the platform independent jar files, then run
		the jar file with the program argument -v. For instance, under
		Windows, the command line for starting PAMGuard Beta version 1.3.02 in
		viewer mode with 1 Gigabyte of memory is: <br> <br>
		<code>java -jar -mx4096m PAMGuardBeta_2_02_15.jar PAMGuard -v</code>
	<h3>Running PAMGuard Viewer</h3>
	<p>When PAMGuard starts in Viewer mode, it will not ask for a psfx
		file, but will instead ask for a database file to open. Normally, you
		should select a database which was previously filled with data from
		PAMGuard.</p>

	<p>When running in normal mode, PAMGuard writes settings to a table
		in the database and Viewer mode will read the settings back from the
		database. This ensures that the PAMGuard configuration you are viewing
		will be compatible with the data in the database.</p>
	<p>
		If data were collected using only <a
			href="../../../utilities/BinaryStore/docs/binarystore_overview.html">Binary
			Storage</a>, of the database is unavailable for some other reason, then
		open a blank database and ignore any warning messages. This will
		create a blank looking PAMGuard with no modules apart from the binary
		store and <a href="../../../utilities/datamap/docs/datamap.html">Data
			Map</a>. You can then import the correct settings from a psfx file to get
		the correct settings into the viewer using the <b>File > Import
			configuration ... </b> menu item.
	</p>

	<p>If you can't find the psfx file that was used to process the
		data, look in the binary storage folder. Each time PAMGuard starts, it
		writes a sopy of the psfx file into the binary storage folder for just
		this situation !.</p>
	<p>
		As an absolute last resort, add the modules you need individually from
		the <b>File > Add Modules ... </b> menu.
	</p>
	<p>

		go to <a
			href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/offline_Overview.html">Click
			Detector Viewer Overview</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Data Scrolling</h3>
	<p>It is not possible to load entire large data sets into the
		Viewer since the program will run out of memory. On the other hand, it
		is inefficient to continually be loading data for display whenever the
		operator scrolls back or forth by a few seconds.</p>
	<p>The PAMGuard viewer therefore uses a sophisticated double scroll
		system in which an outer scroller controls the loading of data into
		memory and an inner scroller moves through that data. For example,
		when viewing clicks with the click detector, an operator will probably
		want to load about 30 minutes of data at a time, but may only view
		minutes or seconds of those loaded data as they make a detailed
		analysis of the clicks.</p>
	<p>Exactly which options are available on individual displays with
		PAMGuard can vary. However, the functionality will generally be a
		subset of that in the click detector:</p>
	<br>

	<p>
	<center>
		<img src="./images/Scroller2.png" />
	</center>
	<br>
	<br>
	</p>
	<p>The main part of the scroller (taking up most of the space on
		the left) is an ordinary scroll bar which allows you to navigate
		through loaded data. To the right are a pair of blue arrow buttons
		with a downward arrow button between them. The blue buttons are used
		to load the next section of data (e.g. to jump forward or backward
		half an hour).</p>
	<p>Click on the downward pointing arrow to display other options:</p>
	<p>
	<center>
		<img src="./images/ScrollerOptions.png" />
	</center>
	<br>
	<br>
	</p>
	<p>Options include the start time of the loaded data, the time
		period of the loaded data, and the percentage movement forward or
		backward when the blue arrows are pressed. (In the example above, 30
		minutes of data are loaded, and there is a 75% step size, so the blue
		arrows would move forward or backward by 22.5 minutes).</p>
	<p>Right click on the downward arrow for an option to couple all
		scrollers in all PAMGuard modules.</p>

	<p>The number in the right hand box shows the duration of data
		actually displayed in the window (120 seconds in the example). This
		can be changed by typing a new number or by using the small up and
		down arrow in the right of the edit box.</p>

	<h4>Play Button</h4>
	<p>Pressing the play button will cause the scroll bar to advance
		automatically, scrolling through the loaded data. Right click on the
		button to select different play speeds.</p>

	<h4>Scroller coupling</h4>
	<p>
		If several displays are shown within the same <a
			href="../../../displays/userDisplayHelp/docs/userDisplayPanel.html">User
			display panel</a>, then their scrollers are automatically 'coupled'. That
		is, if one scoller is moved, the others will also move.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right clicking on the options button will give options to couple all
		scrollers within PAMGuard, i.e. so that when you move a <a
			href="../../../displays/spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html">
			spectrogram display</a> scroller, the click detector time display will
		move with it.
	</p>

	<h4>Dataset navigation</h4>
	<p>
		To assist in navigating through large data sets, the <a
			href="../../../utilities/datamap/docs/datamap.html">Data Map</a> will
		always be added to the PAMGuard model when operating in Viewer mode.
