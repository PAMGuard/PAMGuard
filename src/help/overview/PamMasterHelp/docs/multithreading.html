<h1>PAMGuard</h1>
<h2>Multi-threading</h2>
<p><br>
  PAMGuard can operate in either a single thread mode, or a 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Single-threaded_vs_multithreaded_programs">multi-thread mode</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  In multi-thread mode, each process within each PAMGuard module operates in a different 
  processing thread, which basically allows several processes to take place at once in a multiprocessor computer. 
</p>
<p>
  In single thread mode, actions take place one at a time as data propagates through PAMGuard. 
</p>
<p>
  The advantage of multi-thread operation is that the different tasks will spread between 
  multiple processing cores on the computer, thereby gaining access to more processing power.
</p>
<p>
  In single thread operation, only a single processing core will be used, so less processing 
  power is available.
</p>
<p>
  Multi-threading may introduce instability in some modules, where certain processes have to happen
  in a certain sequence, so although multi-threading is usually  preferable, single thread 
  operation is maintained as an option.</p>
<h3>Turning multi-threading on and off</h3>
<p>Multi-threading can be turned on and off from the <em><strong>Detection>Multi-threading</strong></em> menu command. </p>

<br><p>You can also set the amount of "jitter" between threads. This is the maximum amount of data
that can be queued between two threads. If the data queue exceeds this time, then the earlier
thread will wait until the second thread has processed some of the data in the queue.  </p>
<p>More jitter allows more flexibility between threads which can allow PAMGuard to use multiple 
processor cores more efficiently. However, increased jitter can cause a loss of synchronisation 
between the processing, graphics output and sound play back. Generally, the default setting of 1000ms is
about right for most operations.</p>

<h4>Garbage Collection</h4>
<p>The Java language handles garbage collection (clean up of unused objects in memory) very efficiently. Sometimes though
it's helpful to give it a 'nudge' and tell it to clean up more often in which case the 'Run additional garbage collection' 
option can be used.
