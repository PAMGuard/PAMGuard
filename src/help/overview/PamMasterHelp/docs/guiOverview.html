<h1>PAMGuard</h1>
<h2>Graphical User Interface</h2><br>
<h3>Key Regions of the Graphical User Interface</h3>

<p>
PAMGuard features a dynamic, multi-panel user interface. The key regions of the interface are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main menu</li>
  <li>Tabbed panel area</li>
  <li>Side panel</li>
  <li>Status panel</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Main menu</h3>
<p>

<p>The menus in PAMGuard are generally dynamic, i.e. items on the menus change
depending on the current user-selected view and/or modules selected. 
Most of the settings are accessible through the main menu items, although some actions are carried out exclusively through
mouse operations.  
</p>


<h3>Tabbed panel area</h3>
<p><center><img src="images/tabbedPanel.png"/></center></p><br>
<p>The tabbed panel area gives access to the available plugin module views, by clicking on the appropriate tab.
As you change from one tabbed panel to the next, the menu and side panel items update accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Side panel</h3>
<p><center><img  src="images/sidePanel.png"/></center></p><br>
<p>The side panel allows you to view information from plugin modules, even when their tabbed panel is not selected.</p>
<p>The content of the side panel will depend on which modules have been loaded. The side panel can be collapsed to make
more room for the main tabbed panel by clicking on the small button in the top right hand corner of the side panel.</p>


<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>
The status bar is by default located at the bottom of the PAMGuard window. This view provides information on 
PAMGuard's current status, for example, which sound card is running, which file is processing, available memory, etc.
