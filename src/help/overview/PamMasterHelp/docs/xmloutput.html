<h1>XML Configuration Output</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The XML settings output functions allow the user to save PAMGuard settings to XML files. for technical reasons, 
these do not contain every last setting that controls PAMGuard, so cannot (currently) replace the psf settings system. 
the XML files can only be written by PAMGuard and cannot be read back into PAMGuard. They
can however be used to provide a more human readable record of changing configurations during a PAMGuard operation.</p> 
<p>Future developments may extend this system to write settings to the front of binary files and even to an external 
XML based database system. Currently however, it is only possible to create XML files. These can be created manually,
or automatically every time that PAMGuard starts.</p>

<h2>Control</h2>
<p>XML output is controlled from the File/XML Configuration Output menu command</p>

<h3>Module Selection</h3>
<p>Select to output all PAMGuard modules, a single module, or 'up to a selected module' (for example
if you selected the click detector, in this case it would write out settings for the acquisition module 
as well as the click detector)</p>
<h4>Output non-module data</h4>
<p>Not all settings are associated with a PAMGuard module, for instance display settings, or the settings controlling 
the XML writer itself. Select if you want these settings written as well as module settings</p>
<h4>Include class constants</h4>
<p>These are internal parameters used by PAMGuard that cannot be changed by the user. Generally, you'll 
probably no want to output these</p>
<h4>Write parameter names</h4>
<p>Parameters in the XML output are identified by the variable name used in the JAVA source code. Often it's 
easy for the user to work out how these relate to the controls they see in the PAMGuard control dialog. Select
this option to also write out a more user friendly name of the type that would appear in the dialogs. (Note
that this feature has not yet been implemented for most parameters)</p>
<h4>Write parameter tips</h4>
<p>Write longer tool tips for each parameter (Note
that this feature has not yet been implemented for most parameters). </p> 

<h3>Output Options</h3>
<h4>File Name</h4>
<p>By default, a manually output XML file will be written to the folder or directory holding the psf file and will 
have a datestamp added to it's name. If you want to write to a different location, press the Browse' button</p>
<h4>Automatic XML file generation</h4>
<p>The option to 'Write settings file whenever PAMGuard starts. will write all module settings to an XML file 
every time that PAMGuard starts. If <a href="../../../utilities/BinaryStore/docs/binarystore_overview.html">Binary Storage</a>
 is being used, then XML file will be written to the folder containing the binary data. If binary Storage is not used, then the 
 file will be written to the folder containing the psf file. </p> 

<h3>Preview</h3>
<p>Press the preview button to see the XML output before it is written to file. This is a good
way to see the effect of the various options described above</p>
