<h1>PAMGuard</h1>
<h2>Performance Tests</h2><br>
<p>PAMGuard puts a heavy load on the machine it's running on</p>
<p>Machine performance is dependent not just on the CPU speed but also on 
things like the quality of the graphics card and the types of hard drive</p>
<p>The PAMGuard team are developing a set of performance tests which can be run
from within PAMGuard to assess the likely performance of different platforms</p> 

<h3>Running the performance tests</h3>
<p>
Open the performance tests dialog from the <strong><em>Help>System performance 
Tests</em></strong> menu</p>
<p>Press the 'Start tests' button</p>

<h3>Interpreting the output of the performance tests</h3>
<p>These tests are currently under development and more information will
be provided within the performance tests dialog in the near future</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<p>Test 3 the Double precision number crunching, should execute in 
less than 700 ms.</p>
<p>Test 4 directly drawing dots on the screen should take around 400 - 500 ms</p>
<p>Test 5 drawing dots using a buffered image should take < 100 ms</p>
<p>Test 6 drawing dots using a callback function should take less than 700 ms</p>
<p>These numbers are very preliminary and are based on tests carried out on a Dell Latitude D830
laptop with an Intel Core Duo CPU T9300 @2.5GHz with 3.5 GB of RAM. This machine runs PAMGuard very well.</p>
