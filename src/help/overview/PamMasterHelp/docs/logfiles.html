<h1>PAMGuard</h1>
<h2>Log Files</h2><br>

<p>PAMGuard produces some text output, which is displayed in a "command window" that's often hidden behind the main PAMGuard display.</p>
<br>
<center><img src=images/commandwindow.png></center>
<br>
<p>The text in this window are also written to text files to provide a more permanent record of 
PAMGuard operation and bug reporting.</p>
<p>The log files can be found in the Pamguard sub folder of your user directory. On Windows 
computers, this will be 
C:\Users\***yourusername***\Pamguard.</p>
<p>The easiest way to find this folder is to go to the PAMGuard Help menu and select Log File /  Open Folder.</p>

<p>The text written to this window include important debug information which should be sent to the PAMGuard team 
to help diagnose any problems.</p>

<h3>Disabling log files</h3>
<p>If you don't want to write log files, then you can disable them from the Help / Log Files menu.</p>

<h3>Automatic error reporting</h3>
<p>When PAMGuard starts, it will automatically analyse the most recent log file and search for errors. If 
errors have occurred, it will encourage you to send this log file and error report through the the PAMGuard 
team at bugs@pamguard.org.</p>
<p>This email will not be sent unless you agree, and press send. If you want to diable this feature, you can
do so from the Help / Log Files / Check Log Files at Startup menu option.
