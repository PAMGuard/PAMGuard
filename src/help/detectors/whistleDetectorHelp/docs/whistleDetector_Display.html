<h1>Whistle Detector</h1>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p><br>
  The whistle detector does not have it's own tab panel display. 
</p>
<p>
Whistle detector data can be viewed on a side panel and as a graphic overlay 
on spectrogram displays. 

<h3>Whistle side panel</h3>

<p>
A side panel shows 
a count of recent whistles and whistle events 
</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Spectrogram graphics overlay</h3>

<p>
On a spectrogram display panel pop up menu (right click anywhere on the spectrogram display panel), 
select which detector overlays to display.  
</p>
<p>
Whistles are currently only detected on the first channel of a grouped pair of channels, and whistle output displays will only overlay on the spectrogram of the the channel from which the detections were made.</p>
<p>In the example, in order to show both spectral peaks and whistles channel 0 is displayed in two panels; one has an overlay of 
  spectral peaks, the other an overlay of detected whistles. </p>
