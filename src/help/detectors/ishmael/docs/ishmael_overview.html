	<h2>Ishmael Detectors Overview</h2>
	<p>
		PAMGuard contains three detectors ported from Dave Mellingers <a

			software</a>.

	<p>
		These all have application with many different sound types and all
		feature in the <a
			href="https://www.pamguard.org/tutorials/getstarted.html">Getting
			Started</a> PAMGuard tutorial.
	</p>

	<p>The three detectors vary in their specificity, that is how well
		they must match the sound's your looking for to be of any use.</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="ishmael_energysum.html">energy sum</a> is the least
		specific of any of the detectors, so will likely pick up any transient
		sound that has energy in the frequency band of interest. Generally,
		this detector will work at a very high false alarm rate, but can be
		useful in screening out data to be further processed with other
		classifiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="ishmael_matchedfilter.html">matched filter</a> is the
		most specific and really only responds to sounds that exactly match
		the 'kernel' sound that you've configured it with. Generally, this
		detector is just too specific for most biological data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="ishmael_speccorrelatoin.html">spectrogram correlation</a>
		detector is a bit in the middle of the other two. It will pick out
		sounds that match it reasonably well, but doesn't require the exact
		match of the matched filter.
