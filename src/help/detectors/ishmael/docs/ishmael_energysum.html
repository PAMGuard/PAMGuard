	<h1>Ishmael Energy Sum Detector</h1>
	<h2>Overview of the method</h2>
	<p>In this method, the values in each vertical strip of the
		spectrogram are summed. The sequence of sums, one sum per vertical
		strip, makes up the detection function. Energy summation is a useful
		detection method for scanning sounds to find everything of interest,
		particularly when the target sounds may be unknown or highly variable.
		It can also be used as a first step for a more sophisticated
		multi-step classification system.</p>

	<h3>Adding the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the PAMGuard file menu select <b>Add Modules > Detectors >
			Ishmael energy sum.</b>
	<p>Give a name to the detector, and hit OK.</p>
	<p>
		This detector will require that you also configure a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">FFT
			(Spectrogram) Engine</a> as it's input.
	</p>

	<h3>Configure the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the PAMGuard Settings menu select <b>Ishmael energy sum
			Settings ...</b> to open the dialog

	<p>Select the FFT data source. You should think carefully about 
	the best FFT Length and FFT Hop to use based on the sample rate 
	of your data and the type of sound you are trying to detect. 
	<a href="../../..//sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Configuring.html">See here</a>
	for more information on this important, but often overlooked, topic.  </p>
	
	<p>Select which channels you want to process and how you want them to be grouped. 
	If channels are in the same group, it's slightly easier for the 
	<a href="../../../localisation/docs/localisation_overview.html">PAMGuard localisers</a>
	to measure time delays between data on the different channels, but only if the 
	hydrophones in each group are quite close together. </p>
