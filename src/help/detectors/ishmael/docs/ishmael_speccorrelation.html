	<h1>Ishmael Spectrogram Correlation</h1>
	<h2>Overview of the method</h2>
	<p>
		This method works by cross-correlating a spectrogram of Ishmaelâ€™s
		input signal with a synthetic time-frequency kernel. It works well
		when there is some amount of variability in the call type to be
		detected; certain parameters in construction of the kernel can be
		arranged to allow more or less variability in the calls to be
		detected. The construction of kernels, and their performance, is
		beyond the scope of this guide, but more information is available
		elsewhere (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.429434">Mellinger
			and Clark, 2000</a>).

	<h3>Adding the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the PAMGuard file menu select <b>Add Modules > Detectors >
			Ishmael spectrogram correlation.</b>
	<p>Give a name to the detector, and hit OK.</p>
	<p>
		This detector will require that you also configure a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">FFT
			(Spectrogram) Engine</a> as it's input.
	</p>

	<h3>Configure the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the PAMGuard Settings menu select <b>Ishmael spectrogram
			correlation Settings ...</b> to open the dialog

	<p>Select the FFT data source. You should think carefully about 
	the best FFT Length and FFT Hop to use based on the sample rate 
	of your data and the type of sound you are trying to detect. 
	<a href="../../..//sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Configuring.html">See here</a>
	for more information on this important, but often overlooked, topic.  </p>
	
	<p>Select which channels you want to process and how you want them to be grouped. 
	If channels are in the same group, it's slightly easier for the 
	<a href="../../../localisation/docs/localisation_overview.html">PAMGuard localisers</a>
	to measure time delays between data on the different channels, but only if the 
	hydrophones in each group are quite close together. </p> 
	
	<h4>Create the kernel</h4>
	<p>Create the outline of the sounds you're trying to detect. Before entering data, you'll need to 
	look at some sounds and make measurements of their time frequency contours. Divide the 'typical' contour
	up into sections that can be approximated by straight lines, and enter them here. The start time of 
	each segment should be equal to the end time of any preceding segment. </p>
