	<h1>Ishmael Matched Filter</h1>
	<h2>Overview of the method</h2>
	<p>This method works by cross-correlating a time series input
		signal with another signal that you specify, called the kernel.
		Cross-correlation is the optimum method for detecting a known signal
		in white Gaussian noise. It works best when the signal you wish to
		detect is quite constant from one instance to the next and from one
		animal to the next.</p>
	<p>In animal bioacoustics it's actually quite rare that the signal
		is well enough known (since all natural sounds vary slightly) and the
		noise background is rarely Gaussian, so this detector is rarely
		optimal!</p>

	<h3>Adding the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the PAMGuard file menu select <b>Add Modules > Detectors >
			Ishmael matched filter.</b>
	<p>Give a name to the detector, and hit OK.</p>
	<p>
		This detector will require that you also configure a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">Sound
			Acquisition module</a> or a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">Decimator</a>
		as it's input.
	</p>

	<h3>Configure the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the PAMGuard Settings menu select <b>Ishmael matched filter
			Settings ...</b> to open the dialog
	</p>

	<br>
	<p>
		Select the Raw data source. This must be at the same sample rate as
		the data in the kenel file you're using with the Matched filter. If
		necessary, use a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">Decimator</a>
		module to get your data to the correct sample rate.
	</p>

	<p>
		Select which channels you want to process and how you want them to be
		grouped. If channels are in the same group, it's slightly easier for
		the <a href="../../../localisation/docs/localisation_overview.html">PAMGuard
			localisers</a> to measure time delays between data on the different
		channels, but only if the hydrophones in each group are quite close
		together.
	</p>
<p>Select the kernel file. This must be a short clip containing a single channel of data that contains a typical example of 
the sound you're trying to detect.</p>
