<h1>Whistle and Moan Detector</h1>
<h2>Noise Removal and Thresholding</h2>
<p>Noise removal and thresholding is one of the most important steps
in the operation of the Whistle and Moan detector.</p>
<p>Noise removal and thresholding is a five stage process. The first
stage has to occur before FFT data are calculated in the <a
	href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">
FFT (Spectrogram) Engine</a>. The remaining four stages can take place
either in the <a
	href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">
FFT (Spectrogram) Engine</a> module or in the Whistle and Moan detector.</p>
<p>Performing the noise removal in the <a
	href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">
FFT (Spectrogram) Engine</a> module has the advantage that other PAMGuard
processes and displays will have access to the data</p>
<p>The Whistle and Moan detector will try to ensure that the correct
noise removal processes are run once and only once but looking back at
the FFT data source and testing whether noise removal has already been
done.</p>
<p>Noise removal processes which have already been conducted in an
earlier module cannot be repeated. However, the Whistle and Moan
detector cannot check, and has no control over the configuration of
noise removal processes conducted in earlier modules.</p>
<p>Generally, you should use the default settings</p>

<h3><a name="clickremoval"></a>Click Removal</h3>
<p>This stage of the noise removal has to take place on the raw data
prior to the calculation of the spectrogram. It is therefore carried out
by the <a
	href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">
FFT (Spectrogram) Engine</a>.</p>
<p>The click removal method operates on the time series data prior
to the FFT calculation and therefore affects both output streams of the
FFT Engine.</p>
<p>Click removal measures the standard deviation of the time series
data and then multiplies the signal by a factor which increases rapidly
for large signal components. This has the effect of reducing the
magnitude of short duration transient signals such as echolocation
clicks</p>

<p>Other noise removal stages can be controlled from either the
Whistle and Moan detector dialog or from the <a

FFT (Spectrogram) Engine</a></p>

<h3><a name="medianfilter"></a>Median Filter</h3>
<p>Within each spectrogram slice, the median value about each point
is taken and subtracted from that point.</p>
<h3><a name="averagesubtraction"></a>Average Subtraction</h3>
<p>A decaying average spectrogram is computed and subtracted from
the current spectrogram value.</p>
<h3><a name="kernelsmoothing"></a>Gaussian Kernel Smoothing</h3>
<p>The spectrogram is smoothed by convolving the image with a
Gaussian smoothing kernel</p>
<p>1 2 1<br>
2 4 2<br>
1 2 1.</p>
<h3><a name="thresholding"></a>Thresholding</h3>
<p>A threshold is applied and all data falling below that threshold
set to 0.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="whistleMoan_ConfigConnect.html">Connected
Region Search</a> uses only a binary map of parts of the spectrogram which
are above or below threshold it is generally more useful to output the
input from the raw FFT data which will have been multiplied by the
binary map. This will contain phase and amplitude information which can
be used by the Whistle and Moan detector for measuring time delays
between channels and the overall whistle amplitude.</p>
