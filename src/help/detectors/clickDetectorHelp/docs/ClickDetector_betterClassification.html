<h1>Click Detector</h1>
<h2>Click Classification With Frequency Sweep</h2>
<br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The click classifier with frequency sweep was added to
PAMGUARD
in 2010 to provide a wider choice of species identification parameters,
particularly for the detection of beaked whales.</p>
<p>Operation is similar to that of the <a href="ClickDetector_basicClassification.html"> Basic click
Classifier</a> in so much that a number of different tests can be
carried
out on each click and the click will have to satisfy all of those tests
in order to be classified.</p>
<br>

<h3>General options</h3>
<p>In the general options section, enter the species name, a
unique
identification code and select the symbol to be used for this species
on
the click detector display.</p>
<h4>Channel options</h4>
<p>Click detection is generally conducted on more than one
channel.
If this is the case, then the click classifier can be set to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Require positive identification on all channels
individually</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require positive identification on only one channel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use mean parameter values over all channels</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Restricting the click length</h4>
<p>Click waveforms from the click detector are generally longer
than the click itself. This is partly due to the pre and post samples
added to the waveform but can also be caused by the click arriving at
different times on different channels. The addition
of extra waveform data before or after the click has little effect if
the click has a high signal to noise ratio, but for quiet clicks, the
additional data is a significant
source of noise for some parameter measurements. There is therefore an
option to restrict the
length of the data used in the parameter extractions. If this option is
used, then the peak of the waveform envelope is found (see Click Length
below) and an equal amount of wave data taken from each side of the
envelope maximum. </p>
<p>Generally the click length should be set to a power of 2 (e.g.
128, 256, 512, etc) since the FFT's used in many of the calculations
require data that is an exact power of 2 long. Other values can be
used, in which case
the shortened data will be padded with zeros prior to FFT calculations.</p>
<h3>Waveform Options</h3>
<p>The first tab "Waveform Options" controls classification
parameters relating to the click waveform</p>
<h4>Pre Filtering</h4>
<p>Select this option if you want to filter the click prior to
parameter extraction. Generally measurements such as
the click length will be more accurate if unnecessary noise is first
filtered from the click</p>
<h4>Amplitude Range</h4>
<p>This option can be used to exclude very quiet of loud clicks.
Quiet clicks in particular tend to cause false classification since
their properties are poorly defined so they tend to mis-classify at
random</p>
<h4>Click Length</h4>
<p>The click length is measured by first calculating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_signal">analytic
waveform</a> (or signal envelope) of the click using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform">Hilbert
transform</a> of the waveform data</p>
<p>This is then smoothed using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">moving
average
filter</a> defined by the user (smoothing parameter in dialog).</p>
<p>The maximum of the smoothed envelope is then found and the
click
length taken as the length of the data between points either side of
that maximum which remain above the maximum value minus the threshold
(Threshold parameter in dialog).</p>
<p>The test is passed if the click length lies within the range
set
by the user (Length range parameters in dialog).</p>
<h4>Zero Crossings</h4>
<p>Some species of whale produce frequency modulated clicks, i.e.
the click frequency
changes during the course of the click. </p>
<p>The power spectrum of a click is an
average of the spectral energy over the duration of the click and is
therefore unable
to show changes in frequency during the course of the click.</p>
<p>Although it is possible to extract more detailed frequency
information using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_quasi-probability_distribution">
Wigner-Ville transform</a> of the waveform data. These are slow
to compute and therefore
not suitable for real time classification.</p>
<p>The classifier therefore extracts frequency information by
examining zero crossings of the waveform data.</p>
<p>A zero crossing is defined as the signal waveform going from a
positive to a negative value or vice-versa. The classifier searches the
waveform for zero crossings only within the region of the click between
the thresholded limits from the click length estimation described above.</p>
<p>Once zero crossings have been found, the frequency between
each zero crossing is calculated. If there are three or more zero
crossings
(permitting two or more estimates of frequency) the frequency sweep is
calculated by fitting
a linear model of frequency against time.</p>
<p>Two tests can then be applied to the data. The first is the
total number of zero crossings
which must lie within the range set in the dialog. The second is the
frequency sweep
estimated from the zero crossing data. </p>
<h3>Spectrum Options</h3>
<p>The second tab controls classification parameters extracted
from the clicks spectrum</p>
<br>
<img alt="Click Type" src="images/SweepClassifierTab2.png">
<br>
<h4>Energy Bands</h4>
<p>The energy band test compares the acoustic energy in a test
band
with the energy in two control bands.</p>
<p>The user should enter the frequency ranges of each band and a
threshold value for each of the control bands. The test is passed if
the
test band energy exceeds each of the control band energies by more than
the threshold values.</p>
<p>If only one control band is required, set both frequency
limits
of the second control band to zero.</p>
<h4>Peak and Mean Frequency</h4>
<p>The peak and mean frequency are measured from the power
spectrum
of the click waveform.</p>
<h4>Search and integration range</h4>
<p>The peak search and the frequencies over which the mean
frequency is summed can be restricted using the search and integration
range parameters in the dialog.</p>
<p> The power
spectrum can also be smoothed using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">moving
average
filter</a> to remove noisy spikes from the spectral data.</p>
<h4>Peak Frequency</h4>
<p>If the peak frequency test is enabled, the peak frequency
(taken as the highest
point in the smoothed spectral data between the limits of the Search
and Integration
range) must lie between the limits entered in the dialog. </p>
<h4>Peak Width</h4>
<p>The width of the spectral peak is measured by first finding
the amplitude of the power spectrum at the peak frequency. The peak
width is taken as the frequency range
of the data either side of that peak which are at an amplitude above
the peak amplitude minus
the threshold (threshold parameter in dialog). The test is passed if
the width of the peak lies within the set range. </p>
<h4>Mean Frequency</h4>
<p>The mean frequency is calculated using <br>
<img src="images/MeanFrequency.png"> <br>
where</p>
<p><i>i</i> is the range of frequency bins within the
search and integration range</p>
<p><i>I</i> is the intensity of the spectrum at each
frequency bin <i>i</i></p>
<p><i>f</i> is the frequency (Hz) at each frequency
bin <i>i</i></p>
<p>The test is passed if the mean frequency lies within the set
range. </p>
<h3>Other Options</h3>
<p>The third tab controls other options</p>

<br>
<h4>Alarm</h4>
<p>You can create an audible alarm by setting an alarm on the tab
and by enabling it on the more general classifiction
panel</p>
<br>
<h3>Species Default settings</h3>
<p>The 'Species Defaults' button allows the user to use stored
standard settings for beaked whale and harbour porpoise classifiers.</p>
