<h1>Click Detector Viewer Functions</h1>
<h2>Marking out Events</h2>
<p>
The PAMGuard viewer click detector has the ability to allow manual
marking of events. Events usually consist of a group of clicks
associated with one acoustic encounter of a particular species. Event
information is saved to the database and in certain situations, such as
when using towed arrays, can be used to localise an animal´s position. <br>
<br>
<b>Creating an Event</b>
<br>
<br>
To mark an event bring up the bearing/amplitude time display (in the
Click Detector tab). The Figure shows a porpoise click train which
needs to be marked and stored as an event. Note that the bearing time
display is very similar to the online version
just that instead of the trigger window you get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_quasi-probability_distribution">Wigner
plot </a> as default setting. <br>
<br>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>To see the classified clicks better (in this case porpoise
clicks - the red triangles) you can untick the box at the top of the
window <i>'Unclassified clicks'</i>.
The bearing time display will now only show the classified clicks
(depending on your settings you have more options i.e. echos, other
species, etc.). Right click on a click and select <i>'Label
click...'</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="LabelClick_1" src="images/LabelClick_1.png"></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>This will bring up the event dialog box. Here you can create
a new event by selecting the <i>'New Event'</i> button or
add the click to an existing event by selecting any event from the
Event list.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="Events_1" src="images/Events_1.png"></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>When creating a new event the species/event type can be
selected from the drop down menu. To add a new species/event type to
the database simply right click on the drop down menu and select <i>'Edit
list'</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="CreateNewEvents" src="images/CreateNewEvent.png"></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the Lookup Editor window select <i>'Add Item'</i>
and create a Code, Text and Symbol for your new species/event type.
Press ok.
Now you can select your new Event type/species from the drop down list
in the click event dialog (previous figure).
The Estimated number of animals and the comment are optional but always
useful to fill in. (Note: Dont worry about the event number, PAMGuard
creates an ID automatically.)</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="Lookup" src="images/Lookup.png"></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Multiple clicks can be selected using the advanced area
selection tool. Double click on the bearing/amplitude time display.
This will bring up a dotted line which you can use to draw around a
group of clicks. By joining up the ends of the dotted line the selected
area should appear grey.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center> <img alt="MarkingAnEvent_1" src="images/MarkingAnEvent_1.png"></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>All the clicks within this grey area can be added to an event
by right clicking inside the grey area and selecting <i>'Label
Clicks'</i> or use the key short cut <i>'Ctrl+L'</i>.
Note that there are also other options available such as removing
clicks from a certain event etc. So if you made a mistake, don´t
panick.
Other useful tools for marking an event include the <a href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/offline_tools.html">amplitude
selector</a> and
<a href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/offline_tools.html">zoom
selection</a>.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>Following the described steps your event is saved. You can now
localise it with <a href="../../../localisation/targetmotion/docs/targetmotion_Localising.html">target
motion analysis</a>.
<br>
<br>
All events are saved in the database. To get an overview about your
events go to <i>'Click Detection'</i> and then <i>'Show
events'</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center> <img alt="ShowEvents" src="images/ShowEvents2.png"></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Depending on your selection you see all events in your data
set or only the ones which are in the current period. Right click on an
event and you have the option for editing, deleting or going to the
event.
This comes in handy when you want to move between events.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Events which contain clicks with bearing information can be
viewed in the map tab- simply right click and select <i>'Click
Detector, Tracked Clicks'</i>.
If using a towed array events can be localised using the <a href="../../../localisation/targetmotion/docs/targetmotion_overview.html">target
motion analysis </a>module.
Localisation information will also be displayed on the map.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>You can also send Events to <a href="../../../detectors/roccaHelp/docs/rocca_Overview.html">Rocca</a>
for click analysis. Go to <i>'Click Detection'</i> and
then <i>'Rocca Measurement'</i>.
A new window will open up displaying all of the currently defined
events. Select the events to analyse, and then click <i>'Analyze
Selection'</i></p>
