	<h2>Tracking and Click Train Identification</h2>
	<br>
	<h3>Target Motion Analysis</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		A common method for tracking animals, particularly sperm whales, is to
		use <a
			href="../../../localisation/targetmotion/docs/targetmotion_overview.html">Target
			Motion Analysis</a> or TMA. TMA works by measuring bearings to a sound
		source from multiple locations along a track-line. The crossing points
		of the bearings indicates the location of the tracked sound source.
	</p>
	<p>There are two ways of linking clicks together to form click
		trains when using PAMGuard in 'normal' mode, i.e. analysing data in
		real time. On the click detector bearing time display, clicks assigned
		to a train are shown in colour, depending on the options selected from
		the displays settings menu.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h4>
		<a name="ManualID"></a>Manual Click Train Identification
	</h4>
	<p>The most effective method of click train identification is for
		the operator to manually select clicks from the click detector bearing
		time display which they believe come from the same animal. To track
		clicks manually, right click anywhere on the bearing time display,
		scrolling will then pause and you can then release the mouse over the
		click you wish to mark. A small popup menu will appear with a single
		option to create a New Click Train</p>
	<p>
		<img style="width: 214px; height: 95px;" alt="marking first click"
			src="images/MarkClick1.png">&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>Wait a while until the angle to that click train has changed and
		mark another one in the same way. This time, the menu will have the
		options of adding the click to the existing click train, or creating a
		new click train.</p>
	<p>
		<img style="width: 271px; height: 96px;" alt="marking click"

	</p>
	<p>If you ware tracking multiple animals, then start a New Click
		Train.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h4>Automatic Click Train Identification</h4>
	<p>PAMGuard can attempt to mark Click Trains automatically. To
		enable automatic click train identification go to Click Detection &gt;
		Click Train Identification</p>
	<p>
		<img style="width: 280px; height: 301px;" alt="click train ID options"
			src="images/ClickTrainId.png">
	</p>
	<p>Clicks are associated if there is a regular Inter Click Interval
		(ICI) and the clicks are on a slowly and steadily changing bearing. In
		the control section set the minimum number of clicks for a train to be
		created, the minimum angle for Target Motion Analysis (TMA) to be run
		and in the minimum interval between location and database updates.
		This last parameter is important since the localisation calculations
		can take 100's of milliseconds, so repeating them every time a click
		is added to a click train can cause PAMGuard to run too slowly.</p>
	<p>ICI changes controls the minimum and maximum allowable ICI and
		the change ratio governs how much the ICI can change for a new click
		to be added to an existing click train. For example, if the currently
		measured ICI is 1.0s and the change ratio is 1.2, then the ICI to the
		next click can be anything between 1/1.2 = 0.83s and 1.2s.</p>
	<p>Angle changes is the maximum angular deviation allowed for the
		next click. As a click train is starting, this is the angle difference
		between clicks. Once a train has enough clicks for a localisation,
		it's the angle off from that localisation point.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h4>Correcting Mistakes</h4>
	<p>If you make a mistake tracking manually or if you think the
		automatic train identification has made a mistake, click on the click
		that's been assigned incorrectly and a slightly different menu appears
		giving four options.</p>
	<img style="width: 580px; height: 178px;"
		alt="correcting a marked click" src="images/MarkClickCorrect2.png">
	<br>
	<p></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the click from the train (the click will then not be
			assigned to anything)&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Reassign ALL clicks in that train to a different train&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Reassign that click as a new click train.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Select the train the click should be assigned to (if other
			clicks have been started)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It is very common for the automatic click train identification
		algorithm to break up an obvious click train into many smaller ones.
		This happened when there are pauses or changes in click rate.
		Reassigning all clicks in a train is a handy way of correcting these
		errors in order to generate long click trains which will yield
		accurate localisations.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Database Output</h3>
	<p>Click train information is written to the PAMGuard database
		using the same database tables used for offline data analysis. This
		means that any event marking which took place in real time will be
		available for further offline analysis. Two database tables are used:
		The &#8220;events table&#8221; contains one record of information per
		click train, the second &#8220;clicks table&#8221; contains a record
		for each click in each event. To maintain compatibility with earlier
		versions, the two database tables are called
		Click_Detector_OfflineEvents and Click_Detector_OfflineClicks (the
		name Click_Detector_ in these table names will change to whatever the
		name of the click detector created in the PAMGuard configuration you
		are using and if you have multiple click detectors, multiple tables
		with different names will be created.)</p>
