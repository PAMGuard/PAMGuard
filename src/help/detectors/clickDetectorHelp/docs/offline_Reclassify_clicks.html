<h1>Click Detector Viewer Functions</h1>
<h2>Reclassify click types</h2>
<p>Sometimes your initial click parameter settings need changing.
There is an option in Viewer to reclassify click types which will
change the corresponding binary files.
Go to <i>'Click Detection'</i> and click '<i>Reanalyse
click types</i>'.

<br>
<br>
The click reprocessing window will open giving you various options to
proceed. First you need to decide which data you would like to
reclassify.
The options are: Loaded data, all data or new data. To reprocess all
data is time consuming so if you try out different parameter settings
use the option of loaded data as it is much quicker.
Once you are content with your new settings you can apply it to the
whole data set. JAMIE: WHAT DOES the DELETE OLD DATABASE ENTRIES DO?

<br>
The parameters you can change are:
</p>
<h3>Reclassify clicks</h3>
<p>This brings you to the <a href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickClassification.html">click
classification</a>.
Here you can change either the click parameters or add a new
classification.</p>
<h3>Echo Detection</h3>
<p>This opens the Echo Detection window. Here you can change the
parameters for echo classification. </p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Recalculate click delays</h3>
<p>This opens the delay measurement window. Here you can alter
the setting of how click delays are calculated.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
You can choose either of the two options, both or none. <br>
<br>
<b>Option 1:</b> Filter data before measurement
<br>
This option has the following settings:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Option 2:</b> Use wave form envelope. This takes the
Hilbert Transform of the wave and uses this to calculate time delays
instead of the true waveform. This is useful for spectraly pure signals
which have characteristic wave envelopes, such as Harbour Porpoise
clicks. </p>
<h3>Click bearings</h3>
<p>This option allows you to recalculate click bearings. These
may have changed due to altering the spacing between hydrophone
elements or perhaps you have recalculated the click delays, hence the
bearings will have changed.
<br>
<br>
You can run all 4 reclassification options at once or tick the ones
which are suitable for the analysis. Press <i>'Start'</i>
to beginn the recalculation process.
You can see how far advanced the recaclulation process is in the
progress bar. During re-processing the cancel button will change to a <i>'Stop'</i>
button and when the process is finished it will change to a <i>'Close'</i>
button.
When recalculating large data sets the Close button might not appear
after the last file. Just press Stop instead. </p>
