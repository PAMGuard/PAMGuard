	<h1>Click Detector</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The click detector is used to detect transient signals,
		primarily from odontocete species such as sperm whales, beaked whales
		and harbour porpoises.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Creating an instance of the click detector</h3>

	<p>
		From the <strong><em>File>Add modules>Detectors</em></strong> menu, or
		from the pop-up menu on the data model display, select <i>'Click
			Detector'</i>. Enter a descriptive name for the new detector (e.g. sperm
		whale detector, beaked whale detector, etc) and press Ok.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Configure the Data Source</h3>

	<p>
		Go to <strong><em>Click Detection>Detection Parameters</em></strong>
		to configure the click detector.
	</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		The click detector requires a source of raw data before it can
		operate. This may come directly from a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">Sound
			Acquisition module</a> (e.g. a sound card or a National Instruments
		board) or from processed data such as the output from a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">Decimator</a>
		or <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/FiltersHelp/Docs/Filters_filters.html">Filter</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Select an appropriate input source from the drop down list on
		the click detector Detection Parameters menu,</p>
	<h4>Channel Grouping</h4>
	<p>Use the channel grouping controls to arrange the data channels
		into groups.</p>
	<p>Channels in the same group are analysed together so that if one
		channel in a group is triggered, all channels in that group are
		read-out together to create a detected click.</p>
	<p>The click detector works best if data are analysed in pairs of
		channels. It can then use the time delay within each pair to calculate
		a bearing. If multiple pairs of hydrophones are used, these bearings
		can be crossed to estimate source locations.</p>
	<p>(Click detector output .clk files can also be further analysed
		with RainbowClick software if the channels are arranged in pairs).</p>
	<p>If you only have a pair of hydrophones, then select either 'One
		group' or 'User groups' and set the group numbers to be the same.</p>
	<p>If you have multiple pairs of hydrophones, select 'User groups'
		and arrange the group numbers so that each group contains two channels
		as shown above.</p>
	<p>If you select 'no grouping' each channel will be analysed
		totally independently. There are currently no PAMGuard functions which
		can re-group these single channel clicks for source localisation.</p>

	<h3>Data flow and advanced configuration</h3>
	<p>The data flow through the click detector is shown below</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p>The filters and trigger decision parameters can all be adjusted
		by the user to be optimal for a particular species; and for the
		background noise conditions from a particular vessel and operating
		area. Setting many of these parameters is an expert procedure and
		requires both experience and a thorough understanding of the types of
		sound being detected.</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Filters</h3>
	<p>You will see in the figure above that two filters are used; a
		digital prefilter and a digital trigger filter. Two filters are
		required for the following reason. For optimal detection efficiency,
		the trigger only receives data in the frequency band in which the
		animal is making sound. However, classifiers that assign clicks to a
		particular species will require data from more parts of the spectrum.
		For instance, when detecting harbour porpoises which produce narrow
		band clicks between 100 and 150kHz, the trigger filter is set to a
		band pass filter covering only that frequency range. The pre-filter
		however is set to a high pass filter at 20kHz. The clip data therefore
		contains data in the spectrum between 20kHz and 250kHz, which is used
		by the classifier to distinguish between narrow band porpoise clicks
		and broad band clicks from other sources.</p>
	<p>
		Both filters can be configured. Go to <strong><em>Click
				Detection>Digital pre Filter...</em></strong> or <strong><em>Digital
				trigger filter...</em></strong> respectively. Both filters configured using the <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/FiltersHelp/Docs/Filters_panel.html">Filter Design</a> panel.
	</p>
	<br>


	<h3>Trigger decision</h3>
	<p>The trigger automatically makes a measure of background noise
		and then compares the signal level to the noise level. When the signal
		level reaches a certain threshold above the noise level a click clip
		is started. When the signal level falls to below the threshold for
		more than a set number of bins, the click clip ends and the clip is
		sent to the localisation and classification modules.</p>

	<p>
		Trigger parameters are set in the Triggers tab of the <strong><em>Click
				Detection>Detection Parameters </em></strong> menu:
	</p>
	<br>

		src="images/DetectionParameters-trigger.png" />

	<p>Individual channels can be 'turned off' in the trigger by
		un-checking the appropriate check boxes. Note however, that if a
		deactivated channel is part of a group, that channel will still be
		read if another channel in that group triggers. This feature can be
		used to reduce false triggers if one channel develops a noise problem.
	</p>

	<h4>The maths behind it all</h4>
	<p>
		The noise level <i><b>N</b></i> at sample <i>i</i> is measured using
	</p>
	<br>

	<img alt="noiseLevelEquation (1K)" src="images/noiseLevelEquation.png" />

	<p>
		and the signal level <i><b>S</b></i> is measured using
	</p>
	<br>

	<img alt="signalLevelEquation (2K)"
		src="images/signalLevelEquation.png" />

	<p>
		where <i>&alpha;<sub>N</sub></i> is either the <i>long filter</i>
		parameter when no click is active (i.e. the signal is below threshold)
		or the <i>Long Filter 2</i> parameter when the signal is above
		threshold. <i>&alpha;<sub>S</sub></i> is the <i>Short filter</i>
		parameter. A click is started / stopped when the ratio S/N goes above
		/ below the <i>Threshold</i> parameter.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Click Length</h4>
	<img alt="DetectionParameters-length (9K)"
		src="images/DetectionParameters-length.png" />
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>The click only ends when all chosen channels have been below
		threshold for the number of samples specified by &quot;Min Click
		Separation&quot; .</p>
	<p>The maximum length of a click is set such that click clips are
		limited to a maximum number of samples.</p>
	<p>When a clip is created, a number of extra samples are added to
		the clip before the first and last samples to rise above threshold and
		after the last sample to be above threshold (pre sample and post
		sample in the dialog).</p>
