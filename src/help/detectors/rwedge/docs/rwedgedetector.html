	<h1>Right Whale Edge Detector</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		This is an implementation of the North Atlantic Right Whale detector
		described in <a
			href="https://jcaa.caa-aca.ca/index.php/jcaa/article/view/1586">Gillespie,
			2004</a>
	</p>
	<p>Gillespie, D. (2004). "Detection and classification of right
		whale calls using an edge detector operating on a smoothed
		spectrogram," Canadian Acoustics, 32, 39-47</p>
	
	<p>The detector was designed to detect North Atlantic Right Whale 
	<em>(Eubalaena glacialis)</em> upsweep calls. So far as we're aware, the calls
	of other right whale species (Southern, and Pacific) are similar enough that 
	the detector will work with those calls too. </p>
	<p>The detector is not suitable for use with any other call types, for instance
	right whale gunshot sounds, or calls of other species.</p>
