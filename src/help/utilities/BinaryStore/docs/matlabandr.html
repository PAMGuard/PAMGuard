	<h1>Binary Storage</h1>
	<h2>R, Matlab, and Python</h2>
	<p>
		While the <a
			href="../../../overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">PAMGuard
			Viewer</a> provides a powerful tool for reviewing data offline, many
		researchers want to wrte their own bespoke algorithms to further
		analyse PAMGuard detections or to plot and view the data in ways not
		available within the viewer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Although PAMGuard is fully open source, modifying the Java source code
		requires considerable programming expertise and is not for everyone.
		The PAMGuard team and our collaborators have therefore made available
		library functions for the
		<a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, 
		<a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a>, and 
		<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> 
		programming languages, which
		allow users to unpack binary files into those programming environments
		for further bespoke analysis.
	</p>
	<p>All libraries are freely available. For further information on how to install these libraries, and tutorials
	on how to use them, please refer to the <a href="https://www.pamguard.org/matlabandr.html">PAMGuard Website</a>.</p>
