<h1>Hydrophone Depth Readout</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Hydrophone depth readout module can be used to read
hydrophone depth information from one or more analogue depth sensors which
output a voltage that changes as hydrophone depth changes.</p>
<p>For current loop depth sensors (which output a current
proportional to depth), the current output can be passed through a small
resistor create a voltage.</p>
<p>The system currently only works with MeasurementComputing data acquisition 
cards (<a href="http://www.mccdaq.com">www.mccdaq.com</a>) but may be extended 
to support other devices in the future.</p>
<p>Time-stamped depth information is passed to the 
<a href="../../hydrophoneArrayManagerHelp/docs/Array_Overview.html">
hydrophone array manager</a> which makes it available to other 
PAMGuard modules as required, the information from the sensors effectively overriding the 
default depth information in the 
<a href="../../hydrophoneArrayManagerHelp/docs/Array_Configuration.html">hydrophone array configuration dialog</a>.</p>

<p>A small side panel shows a graph of recent depth history.</p>

<h3>Database output</h3>
<p>Both the raw voltage data and the calculated depth for each
sensor are written to the <a
	href="../../generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html">database</a>.
It is therefore possible to recalculate depths off-line if depth sensors
are re-calibrated at any point. (PAMGuard will not currently do
this for you - you'll have to work it out for yourself using your own
software). <br>
