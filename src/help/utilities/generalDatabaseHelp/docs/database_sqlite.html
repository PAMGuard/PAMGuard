	<h1>Database</h1>
	<h2>SQLite Databases</h2>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is a single file database
		and is an excellent replacement for Microsoft Access. Data are stored
		in a single file which can easily be backed up and copied between
		computers.
	</p>
	<p>
	SQLite is cross platform so should work on Mac's and Linux platforms as well as Windows. 
	</p>
	<p>
		SQLite is open source and free to use. A number of viewers are
		available to enable you to view data directly within the database
		file. We have tested and recommend SQLiteStudio which can be
		downloaded <a href="http://sqlitestudio.pl/">here</a>.

	<h3>Configuring an SQLite database</h3>
	<img src="Images/databaseSQLite.png" />
	<br>
	<p>PAMGuard will automatically create the necessary .sqlite3
		database file on your computer.</p>
	<p>You do not need to add tables to the database, PAMGuard will
		automatically create the tables it needs.</p>
	<h4>Auto commit</h4>
	<p>If Auto commit is selected, the database file will be updated every time a new record is written
	to the database. This can have a serious impact on overall performance, so it not recommended.</p>
	<p> If you have NOT
	selected auto commit, then changes will be written to the database at the following times:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Every three seconds</li>
	<li>Whenever the number of uncommitted records reaches 10
	<li>Whenever PAMGuard stops</li>
	<li>Whenever PAMGuard exits</li>
	<li>Whenever tables are added to the database, or the database structure changed in any way</li>
	<li>In <a href="../../../overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">Viewer Mode</a>, whenever the data about to be reloaded.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You can also commit changes at any time, using the menu command 
	<b>File/Database/Commit Changes</b>.</p>
