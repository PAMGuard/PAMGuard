		<a	href="https://tethys.sdsu.edu/">Tethys</a> is a freely
		available open source temporal-spatial database for metadata related
		to acoustic recordings. The database is intended to house the metadata
		from marine mammal detection and localization studies, allowing the
		user to perform meta analyses or to aggregate data from many
		experimental efforts based on a common attribute. This resulting
		database can then be queried based on time, space, or any desired
		attribute and the results can be integrated with external datasets
		such as NASA's Ocean Color, lunar illumination, etc. in a consistent
		manner. While Tethys is designed primarily for acoustic metadata from
		marine mammals, the design is general enough to permit use in other
		areas as well.
		
	</p>
	<p>PAMGuard is compatible with <a href="https://tethys.sdsu.edu/tethys3/">Tethys 3.0</a> or above, released early in 2024. </p>
	<p>The Tethys database is not a replacement for the existing 	
	<a href="../../generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html">PAMGuard Database.</a> 
	Where the PAMGuard database only contains data from a single instrument or cruise, the Tethys
	database contains data from many cruises and projects and can be used to hold a summary of all data 
	from a lab or organisation.
	</p>
	
	<p>Before using the module in PAMGuard, you should install the Tethys Server, which runs under 
	Windows. <a href="https://tethys.sdsu.edu/install/">
	Instructions for installing the Tethys Server can be found here.</a></p>
