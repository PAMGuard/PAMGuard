	<h1>Species and Call Type Names</h1>
	<br>
	<p>When exporting data from PAMGuard to Tethys, some PAMGuard
		records will require additional information indicating what type of
		animal or phenomena were detected. If a specific call-type was
		detected, e.g. "Clicks" or "Whistles", these should be noted as well.</p>

	<h2>Species Names</h2>
	<p>
		Tethys uses the <a href="https:itis.gov">Integrated Taxonomic
			Information System</a> (ITIS) to encode species names as taxonomic serial
		numbers (TSNs), unique numeric identifiers for species. These data
		conform with several international coding systems which are described
		on the <a href="https://itis.gov/standard.html">ITIS standards</a>
		page.
	</p>

	<p>It is not uncommon to be unable to describe a call to the genus
		level. In such cases, one can use a higher taxonomic level. For
		example, beaked whale echolocation clicks are distinctive from the
		clicks of other toothed whales as their pulses have a
		frequency-modulated component. While they can frequently be associated
		with the family Hyperodontidae, it is not always possible to associate
		a click to a specific species as many of the at least twenty-two
		species remain understudied. In such a case, we would use the TSN for
		Hyperodontidae, 770799. While not currently supported by PAMGuard,
		each species identifier has an optional Group attribute that can be
		used in an ad-hoc manner to provide additional information. This can
		be used to add population markers, tentative genus groups, etc.</p>

	<p>ITIS does not describe abiotic sounds, Tethys records such
		sounds as follows:
	<ol>
		<li>For anthropogenic signals, the Tethys convention is to use <em>Homo
				sapiens</em>, TSN 180092, for the species code and describe the
			human-generated signal via a call type, e.g. ship, mid-frequency
			active sonar, etc.
		</li>
		<li>Tethys reserves the TSN -10 for geophonic signals. The call
			type is used to describe the source. Examples include ambient sound,
			earthquake, rain, etc. Note that negative TSNs are not part of the
			ITIS standard.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	Note that in general, you do not have to worry about remembering TSNs.
	Tethys uses TSNs internally, but will translate TSNs to/from Latin
	names or user-defined abbreviations both when querying and presenting
	results.

	<h2>Call types</h2>

	<p>Some detectors identify specific call types. When this is the
		case, users will need to specify the call type name. While species
		names are standardized in Tethys, call names do not have a
		well-defined standard and experts frequently use different names for
		the same type of call. Consequently, Tethys does not provide a
		standard coding for call types and users are free to choose the call
		type names with which they feel most comfortable.</p>

	<p>
		That said, the authors of Tethys do however provide a list of
		recommend call types for many species. These recommendations can be
		accessed in the <a
			href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1574954115001983-mmc1.docx">
			supplemental information</a> of the open access article "Management of
		acoustic metadata for bioacoustics," Roch et al. (2016), (<a
			href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.12.002">DOI:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.12.002</a>).
	</p>

	<p>
		Within PAMGuard, different detectors have different numbers of call
		types. Some, such as the <a
			href="../../../detectors/whistleMoanHelp/docs/whistleMoan_Overview.html">Whistle
			and Moan detector</a>, have only one fixed call type "Tonal", for others
		such as the <a
			href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickClassification.html">Click
			Detector</a>, the user can define any number of different call types in
		the click classification configuration. The Tethys interface allows
		the user to map the internal call types from PAMGuard to ITIS species
		codes and call types.
	</p>

	<h2>Export dialog</h2>

	<p>Before you can export records to Tethys, you must complete a
		mapping that can translate the ad-hoc encodings defined within
		PAMGuard to valid ITIS codes and call types. The dialog for these
		mappings can be accessed in two ways, firstly, in the table of
		PAMGuard data blocks in the lower left of the display, right click on
		any row and select the menu item "PAMGuard ITIS Species mapping ...",
		Otherwise, a similar dialog will appear as a page with the export
		wizard once you've pressed the "Export ..." button.</p>

	<p>PAMGuard events typically are a short name that represents the
		species and/or potentially a call. Knowledge of the PAMGuard modules
		that were run and the data on which they executed will let a user
		infer what should be recorded. The dialog below shows a sample set of
		species defined in the PAMGuard click detector, where the user has
		defined the codes Porpoise, BWC, Oo, Pm, UNK, and Zc. Note that the
		first entry "Click" has been added automatically as a default for when
		no classification result was returned.
	<div>
		<img src="./images/species_codes1a.png" class=".center" />
	</div>
	<br> In the dialog above, we can infer that the only porpoise
	present in the study area was Harbour Porpoise, so have selected ITIS
	code 180473,
	<em>Phocoena phocoena</em>. However, the identity of species BWC is
	unclear, though believed to be some type of beaked whale, so it has
	been given the code 770799 for
	<em>Hyperoodontidae</em>.

	</p>

	An ITIS code and call/sound type can be associated with each event. The
	dialog lists:
	<ul>
		<li>Name - The ad-hoc name given by the PAMGuard module. This may
			not be changed.</li>

		<li>ITIS code -This is the ITIS TSN that is associated with
			PAMGuard event code. Click on Find to inovke the TSN search dialog
			whose behavior is described in the <a href="#TSNLookup">next
				section</a>.
			<p>If you happen to know the TSN, you can enter it directly.
				Pressing Find after typing the TNS will populate the Latin and
				English vernauclar names so that you may verify your TSN was entered
				correctly.</p>
		</li>

		<li>Call / sound type - This will default to the code provided by
			the module but should be updated to specify an appropriate call type
			or left blank to indicate that the detection is not related to a
			specific call type. In the case of a porpoise detector, the likely
			call type would be "Clicks". <strong>We should double check
				that no Call element is generated when this is blank.</strong>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once all species names and call/sound types have been
		identified, press the Okay button.</p>



	<a name="TSNLookup"></a>
	<h2>Searching for ITIS Taxonomic Serial Numbers (TSNs)</h2>

	<p>As noted above, pressing Find without typing a TSN will bring up
		a search dialog:</p>

	<div>
		<image src="./images/species_search.png" class=".center" />
	</div>

	<p>The top of this dialog has a search box where one can enter
		either a Latin name or the common name for a species. The Tethys
		server will search for all species that match the search-box contents.
		For many species, there are common name entries in languages other
		than English, and these are searched as well.</p>
	<p>Once you press the search button, a list will appear with all
		matches for your search term. If there are too many, a scroll bar will
		permit you to look through the list. Select the entry that you wish
		and press OK. The TSN on the species dialog will be populated along
		with the Latin name and common names from the ITIS database.</p>
	<h2>Export and Import</h2>
	<p>
		Entering all of these codes can get a little tedious and you'll
		hopefully also want to be consistent between your different datasets.
		PAMGuard therefore has options to save the species mapping to a file,
		which can then be re-imported into a different configuration. 
		</p>
		Mappings are stored individually for each PAMGuard datablock and are identified
		by the datablock name. To Export, go to the "Tethys/Export Species Maps ..." menu
		and in the dialog, select the maps you want to export.</p>
<br><br>
	<div>
		<image src="./images/exportmap.png" class=".center" />
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>You will be then be asked for the name of a file to export to and data will be saved to that 
	file. </p>
	<p>Importing is similar: From the Tethys menu, select "Import Species Maps ... ", you will be asked
	to select a previously exported file, and can then choose which maps to import.</p>
