  <h1> Species and Call Type Names </h1>

  When exporting data from PAMGuard to Tethys, some PAMGuard records
  will require additional information indicating what type of animal
  or phenomena were detected.  If a specific call-type was detected,
  e.g. "Clicks" or "Whistles", these should be noted as well.
  
  <h2> Species Names </h2>
  <p>
    Tethys uses the <a href="https:itis.gov">Integrated Taxonomic
    Information System</a> (ITIS) to encode species names as taxonomic
    serial numbers (TSNs), unique numeric identifiers for species.
    These data conform with several international coding systems which
    are described on the <a href="https://itis.gov/standard.html">ITIS
    standards</a> page.  
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not uncommon to be unable to describe a call to the genus
    level.  In such cases, one can use a higher taxonomic level.  For
    example, beaked whale echolocation clicks are distinctive from the
    clicks of other toothed whales as their pulses have a
    frequency-modulated component.  While they can frequently be
    associated with the family Hyperodontidae, it is not always
    possible to associate a click to a specific species as many of the
    at least twenty-two species remain understudied.  In such a case,
    we would use the TSN for Hyperodontidae, 770799.  While not
    currently supported by PAMGuard, each species identifier has an
    optional Group attribute that can be used in an ad-hoc manner to
    provide additional information.  This can be used to add
    population markers, tentative genus groups, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    ITIS does not describe abiotic sounds, Tethys records such sounds as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>
	For anthropogenic signals, the Tethys convention is to
	use <em>Homo sapiens</em>, TSN 180092, for the species code
	and describe the human-generated signal via a call type,
	e.g. ship, mid-frequency active sonar, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	Tethys reserves the TSN -10 for geophonic signals.
	The call type is used to describe the source.  Examples
	include ambient sound, earthquake, rain, etc.  Note that negative TSNs
	are not part of the ITIS standard.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  Note that in general, you do not have to worry about remembering
  TSNs.  Tethys uses TSNs internally, but will translate TSNs to/from
  Latin names or user-defined abbreviations both when querying and
  presenting results.

  <h2> Call types </h2>

  <p>
    Some detectors identify specific call types.  When this is the
    case, users will need to specify the call type name.  While
    species names are standardized in Tethys, call names do not have a
    well-defined standard and experts frequently use different names
    for the same type of call.  Consequently, Tethys does not provide a
    standard coding for call types and users are free to choose the call
    type names with which they feel most comfortable.
  </p>

  <p>
    That said, the authors of Tethys do however provide a list of recommend call
    types for many species.  These recommendations can be accessed in the
    <a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1574954115001983-mmc1.docx">
    supplemental information</a> of the open access article "Management of acoustic metadata
    for bioacoustics," Roch et al. (2016),
    (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.12.002">DOI:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.12.002</a>).

  <h2>
    Export dialog
  </h2>

  <p>
    During export of records that are species-specific, a dialog will
    appear that lists the types of events that were found by PAMGuard
    modules.  This dialog permits users to specify how the ad-hoc species
    species/call encoding scheme used by PAMGuard modules can be systematically
    translated to the TSNs and call types are stored in Tethys.
  </p>

  <p>
    PAMGuard events typically are a short name that represents the
    species and/or potentially a call.  Knowledge of the PAMGuard
    modules that were run and the data on which they executed will let
    a user infer what should be recorded.
    
    The dialog below shows a sample set of events produced by one or more PAMGuard modules
    using the names:  HP, DO, SON, KW, UNK, and PHP:

  <div>
      <img src="./images/species_codes.png" class=".center"/>
  </div>

  The dialog above was produced from detections on data that were
  recorded near the mouth of the River Tay in Scotland.  Consequently,
  we can infer that the harbour porpoise that is denoted by "HP" is
  <em>Phocena phocena</em>, the only harbour porpoise endemic to
  Scottish waters.
  </p>
  
  An ITIS code and call/sound type can be associated with each event.  The dialog lists:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Name - The ad-hoc name given by the PAMGuard module.  This may not be changed.
    </li>

    <li>
      ITIS code -This is the ITIS TSN that is associated with PAMGuard
      event code.  Click on Find to inovke the TSN
      search dialog whose behavior is described in the <a href="#TSNLookup">next
	section</a>.
      <p>
	If you happen to know the TSN, you
	can enter it directly.  Pressing Find after typing the TNS will
	populate the Latin and English vernauclar names so that you may
	verify your TSN was entered correctly.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li> Call / sound type - This will default to the code provided by
      the module but should be updated to specify an appropriate call
      type or left blank to indicate that the detection is not related
      to a specific call type.  In the case of a porpoise detector,
      the likely call type would be "Clicks".
      <strong>We should double check that no Call element is generated when this is blank.</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Once all species names and call/sound types have been identified, press the Okay button.
  </p>


  
  <a name="TSNLookup"></a>
  <h2> Searching for ITIS Taxonomic Serial Numbers (TSNs) </h2>

  <p>
    As noted above, pressing Find without typing a TSN will bring up a
    search dialog:
  </p>

  <div>
    <image src="./images/species_search.png" class=".center"/>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    The top of this dialog has a search box where one can enter either
    a Latin name or the common name for a species.  The Tethys server
    will search for all species that match the search-box contents.
    For many species, there are common name entries in languages
    other than English, and these are searched as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you press the search button, a list will appear with all
    matches for your search term.  If there are too many, a scroll bar
    will permit you to look through the list.  Select the entry that
    you wish and press OK.  The TSN on the species dialog will be
    populated along with the Latin name and common names from the ITIS
    database.
