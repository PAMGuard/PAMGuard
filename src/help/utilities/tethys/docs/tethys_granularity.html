    <h1>Tethys Granularity</h1>
    <h2>Tethys Granularity</h2>
    <p>
        When exporting Detections to Tethys, you must select the "Granularity" for the exports. This will be one
        of the following: 
        <ul>
        <li>Call - each detected call, or noise measurement is individually output to Tethys.</li>
        <li>Binned - Counts of calls in fixed time bins are output to Tethys.</li>
        <li>Encounter - Counts of calls forming and Encounter, that is a period of calling without a predetermined gap between calls. </li>
        <li>Grouped - A Count of groups of calls associated in some other way (for instance through manual grouping of detections).</li>
        </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>Binned granularity will require you to enter the duration of each bin, and a minimum number of calls for a bin to be output (e.g. you might set this above 
    1 if there were occasional false positive detections, but when the animals do call, you tend to get lots of them).</p>
    <p>Encounter granularity will require you to enter a minimum gap between calls which would constitute a new encounter. As with Binned, you also enter
    a minimum number of calls for a bin to be output</p>
    
    <p>
    Encounter and Binned granularities also offer to output separate records for each detection channel (or hydrophone), or to group detections across channels. The former
    would be most appropriate for widely spaces hydrophones, where you'd expect different encounters on each hydrophone, whereas the latter would be more suitable if the 
    hydrophones were spaced close enough together that you'd expect broadly the same detections on them all. </p>
