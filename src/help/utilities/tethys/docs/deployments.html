  <h1>Deployments</h1>
<br>
  <p>
    Tethys uses deployment records to register information about
    when instruments have been deployed as well as their
    characteristics.  Examples of characteristics that are recorded
    include sample rate and the number of quantization bits,
    description of duty cycles (if applicable), hydrophone geometry,
    and enough details to be able find calibration data for specific
    hydrophones.
  </p>

  <p>
    PAMGuard will examine the       
    <a href="../../generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html">PAMGuard
      database</a>
    and <a href="../../BinaryStore/docs/binarystore_overview.html">
    binary Store</a> to determine what records should be generated for
    your instrumentation.
  </p>
    
    <p>
      Where data were collected continuously or on a regular duty
      cycle, PAMGuard will create a single deployment record.  If data
      were collected on a more "ad-hoc" basis, where the instrument
      has been deployed multiple times or has irregular recording,
      PAMGuard will generate a deployment record for each period of
      recording.
    </p>

    <p>
      The figure below shows an example of ad-hoc recording periods
      identified by PAMGuard:
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="./images/deploymentspanel.png" class=".center"
	   alt="Panel showing recording times/deployments for this PAMGuard database"/>
    </div> 

    <p>
      Occasionally, there may be short recording periods (e.g. while
    you were testing kit on deck) that you do not want to export. Use
    the select checkbox to pick all of the rows that you wish to
    export, or right click on the table and "Select All."
    </p>

    <p>
      When one or more deployment records are selected, the
    "Export..."  button will become available.  Selecting the export
    button will start a dialog that asks for additional information
    about the deployments and then write records to Tethys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first page of the dialog asks for the project and geographic
      region which will be automatically populated if they have been
      previously specified. In addition, the following fields are
      requested:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cruise name - Optional name of the deployment cruise</li>
      <li>Site - Case-sensitive name for the deployment site,
	e.g. "Tanner Banks" or a letter designation "T".  This can
	provide a simple way to identify multiple deployments at the
	same general location.
      </li>
      <li>Responsible Party - A set of fields describing who was
	responsible for the deployment and how they may be
	contacted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The next page of the dialog asks whether you would like to
      export a single deployment document or multiple deployments.
      <strong>todo:  add more detail here</strong>
    </p>
    

    <p>
      Finally, you are prompted to provide optional textual descriptions of:
      <ul>
	<li> Objectives - What were your objectives when deploying the
	  instrument?  Example: Determine population estimates for
	  critically endangered populations of vaquita (<em>Phocoena
	  sinus</em>).
	</li>
	<li> Abstract - A textual description of the deployment.
	  Example:  A set of high frequency recorders  were deployed across the
	  northern portion of the Sea of Cortez in the historical range
	  of the vaquita (<em>Phocoena sinus</em>).  These recordings will
	  support detection and density estimation efforts.	  
	</li>
	<li>
	  Method - A description of the methods used.  Example:
	  Small boat deployment of bottom moored SoundTrap recorders
	  with acoustic releases.  
	</li>
      </ul>

      Press Finish to export the records.  Once the
      document(s) have been successuflly exported, the document name
      associated with each recording period will be shown in the
      Tethys Deployment column.
