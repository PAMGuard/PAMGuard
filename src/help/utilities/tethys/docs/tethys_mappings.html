    <h1>Tethys Mappings</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
  
    <p>It is important that when PAMGuard Viewer is connected to a Tethys database, that it can 
    correctly display lists of Tethys documents for that PAMGuard dataset. This help page explains the 
    relationships between PAMGuard datasets and Tethys documents. </p>
    <p>A PAMGuard dataset is likely to consist of a database, and of a folder of binary files. There may
    also be sound recordings, though these are not required here.  </p>
    <p>A Tethys database is likely to contain data from multiple PAMGuard datasets. These will be in the form of 
    Calibration, Deployment, Detection, and Localization documents. Because the database name may change for a 
    PAMGuard dataset, it is not used in the relationships between PAMGaurd and Tethys. Instead, the
    relationship relies on the Project name and on Instrument identification from the Array Manager.</p>
     
    <h3>Deployments</h3>
    <p>
        Deployment documents are at the heart of the link between PAMGuard and Tethys.
