<title>Tethys PAMGuard Mappings</title>

	<h1>Tethys Mappings</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p>It is important that when the PAMGuard Viewer is connected to a
		Tethys database, that it can correctly display lists of Tethys
		documents for that PAMGuard dataset. This help page explains the
		relationships between PAMGuard datasets and Tethys documents.</p>
	<p>A PAMGuard dataset is likely to consist of a database, and of a
		folder of binary files. There may also be sound recordings, though
		these are not required here.</p>

	<p>
		A Tethys database is likely to contain data from multiple PAMGuard
		datasets. These will be in the form of Calibration, Deployment,
		Detection, and Localization documents. Because the database name may
		change for a PAMGuard dataset, it is not used in the relationships
		between PAMGaurd and Tethys. Instead, the relationship relies on the <b>Project</b>
		name and on <b>Instrument Id</b> from the Array Manager. Because a
		project may have made several deployments using the same instrument,
		the dates of the Deployment are also used.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each document in a Tethys database has a <b>Name</b> (analogous to a file name and will indeed
	be the name of the temporary file created when the data were exported) and an <b>Id</b> (often 
	referred to as the Document Id for clarity). For Deployment, Detections, and Localizations 
	documents, PAMGuard will always use the same Name and Id. This is not possible for Calibrations, 
	since there may be multiple copies of Calibrations documents <a href="#calibrations">(see below)</a>. 
	</p>

	<h3>Deployments</h3>
	<p>Deployment documents are at the heart of the link between
		PAMGuard and Tethys. These are identified by the <b>Project Name</b>
		from the Projects metadata, and the
		<b>Instrument Id</b> from the Array Manager. When you open a PAMGuard dataset
		in Viewer mode, PAMGuard will query the Tethys database for all
		Deployment documents that have the same Project Name and the same
		Instrument Id and then from that list it will select those deployments
		which overlap in time with the PAMGuard data. The Instrument
		Type in the Array Manager is not used in this linkage.</p>
	<p>This system is robust, since it is impossible to have the
		same instrument in two places at the same time. However it does
		require care on the part of the user to be consistent and careful in
		setting the Project Name and Instrument Id in PAMGuard.</p>
		<p>For a static mooring, whether recording continuously or on a duty
		cycle, there will be one Deployment document for each PAMGuard dataset.</p>
		<p>For vessel based surveys, where data collection periods may have been more
		ad-hoc (for instance only during the day time or periods of good weather), there may
		be multiple Deployment documents, one for each recording period.</p>
		
	<h3>Detections and Localizations</h3>
	<p>Every Detections and Localizations document has a cross reference to a 
	Deployment document. Therefore, to find these documents, PAMGuard first searches
	the database for matching Deployment documents, then for every Deployment document
	matched to the dataset, it runs additional queries to search for Detections and 
	Localisations that match each Deployment. </p>
	
	<a name="calibrations"><h3>Calibrations</h3></a>
	<p>Calibrations documents should be created for every hydrophone or microphone within
	the "Instrument" used for a deployment. Because a device may be reused on many 
	Deployments or even across multiple Projects, and it may or may not have been calibrated for each one (or perhaps calibrated
	twice for each Deployment - before and after), the relationship between Calibrations, Deployments, 
	and a PAMGuard dataset can be more complex.  </p>
	<p>PAMGuard creates a name for each calibration document consisting of the Instrument Name and the Instrument Id from 
	the Array Manager and the channel number. Spaces in names are replaced with underscore characters. 
	e.g. if a Instrument Name was "SoundTrap HF600" and the Instrument Id was "64232", and the channel number 0, then 
	the calibration document Id would be	</p>
	<code>
	SoundTrap_HF600_64232_ch00
	</code>
	<p>However, since there may be multiple calibration documents for the same device, the document name would also contain
	todays date, and would be something like</p>
	<code>
	SoundTrap_HF600_64232_250112_ch0
	</code>
	<p>for a document created on 12 January, 2025.</p>
	<p>When querying the Tethys database for matching Calibrations documents, PAMGuard first reads ALL Calibrations 
	documents from the database, then selects all of those which have an Id starting with the combined
	Instrument Name and Instrument Id (in this case <code>SoundTrap_HF600_64232</code>). 
	This selection will not use the document date, since the date of the calibration may not lie within the time
	period of the Deployment. It is therefore possible that you will see multiple copies of similar calibration 
	documents when you link PAMGuard to a Tethys database. This is fine, the only requirement being that there 
	is at least one calibration document for each hydrophone before PAMGuard will allow you to export Deployments
	or Calibrations.
