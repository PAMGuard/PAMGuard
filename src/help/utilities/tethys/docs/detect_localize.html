  <h1>Exporting Detections/Localizations (PAMGuard data blocks)</h1>
    <br>
  <p>
    The bottom left panel of the Tethys module shows a list of
    different types of PAMGuard data that can be exported.  The data
    in this list correspond to the various PAMGuard modules that have
    been configured.  See the
    <a href="../../../overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/modelViewer.html">
      data model viewer</a>
    help for an example of how PAMGuard might be configured.
  </p> 
  
  <h2>Species information</h2>

  <p>
    Some of these data represent detections of specific species or
    phenomena that must be translated to Tethys.  A context menu
    (right-click on most computers) will show the option "Species
    info..." that will allow you to specify the
    <a href="./tethys_speciescodes.html">translation of events</a>
    to species identifiers and call/sound types.  If you try to export
    without having done this, the species info dialog will be started
    automatically prior to export.
  </p>

  <h2>Selecting data blocks for import</h2>
  
  <p>
    In the sample data blocks below, four modules have been
    configured, but only one of them has been run.  Column "N Pam
    Data" indicates the number of data records that have been
    produced, and "PAMGuard Time" tells us when the data were
    processed.  "Tethys Documents" indicates how many Tethys records
    have been produced, and should be 0 until the data are exported.
  </p>
    
  <div>
    <img src="./images/data_blocks.png" class=".center"
	 alt="List of results showing detections and other module processing events"/>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Select the data blocks to be exported by clicking on them.
    Multiple lines can be selected by using keyboard modifiers such as
    holding the shift while clicking to select all data blocks between
    the last clicked block and where you click.  Holding the alternate
    (ALT) key will allow selection or de-selection of a single item
    without affecting the selection state of other blocks.
  <p>

  <p>
    <em>
      SUGGESTION:  It looks like we have to highlight these by clicking
      on them.  As we use select boxes for recording periods, we might
      want to do the same thing here...  We might want to rename
      N PAM Datas to N PAM Data as data are already plural.
    </em>
  </p>

  <h2> Exporting data blocks </h2>

  <p>
    Once the data blocks have been selected, press export.  A series
    of dialogs will guide you through the export process.  The first
    set of dialogs simply display a summary of information about what 
    will be exported.
  </p>

  <div>
    <img src="./images/stream_algo_info.png" class=".center"
	 alt="List of details describing the mechanism, parameters, and version of modules used in processing"/>
  </div>
    
  <p>
    There is nothing to change in this summary.  Press Next once you
    have reviewed it.  The second panel allows specification of your
    objectives, abstract, and method.  Many modules will have
    pre-populated the method for you.  While it is recommended to populate
    the objectives and abstract, these fields are optional.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Press Next to proceed to the next step of the dialog.  You will be asked
    what details you wish to store within the parameters that were used to
    produce these data.  Your must select one of the following:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> 
      None - Do not report any of parameters used to produce these
      detections. This option is <strong>not recommended</strong> as
      it severely limits your ability to reproduce your results at a
      later date or know whether or not the results of different
      studies can be used together. 
    </li>
    <li> Data selector only - <strong>not sure what this is</strong> </li>
    <li>
      Module only - Report the parameters that were set with this
      module.  Only parameters associated with the specific module
      will be reported.  Examples include score and duration thresholds
      as well as any other type of criterion used to determine whether
      or not an event is associated with a specific phenomenon or species.
    </li>
    <li>
      Full process chain (default) - This is the most verbose option.  It includes the module
      parameters as well as anything else that is part of the signal processing chain that leads
      to the module.  As an example, a module only setting would not report the parameters that were
      used to generate a spectrogram that was presented to a module for classification, but the
      full process chain would record these details as well.  Use this option will dramatically
      increase the potential to reproduce your results, but it will generate a large amount of data
      about the signal processing chain, much of which might not be useful.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The final page of the dialog has an "Export data" button.  Press
    this to export the data.  The system will begin generating the
    Tethys document and the "Export data" button will be relabeled "Export complete"
    once it is done.  At this point, you can press "Finish" to close
    the dialog.

    <em>Would it make more sense to export when the user presses
    Finish (or change the Finish button Export)?</em>
