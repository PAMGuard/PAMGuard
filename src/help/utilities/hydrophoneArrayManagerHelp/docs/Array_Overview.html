<h1>Hydrophone Array</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>NEW Array localisation system !</h3>
<p>PAMGuard users are deploying more and more complicated arrays and may now be working 
with some hydrophones deployed from a vessel while others are on free floating buoys. Other users are adding 
heading, pitch and roll sensors to their systems.</p>
<p>To cater for these developments the array management and localisation system has been substantially updated
so that arrays containing multiple types of streamer / buoys, etc. can be effectively managed.</p>  

<p>
Within the PAMGuard framework, an "Array" refers to all of the hydrophones
currently in use and only a single "Array" is loaded into memory and used at any one time. 
</p><p>
An array may contain multiple "Streamers" or clusters of hydrophones. Hydrophones within 
each streamer (or cluster) are assumed to be connected to one another in some way and have a common origin. 
Within this context a moored or drifting buoy should be considered as a streamer.   
The streamer origin will generally be referenced to the vessels GPS position, or a fixed Latitude and Longitude.  
</p><p>
Each streamer has a Hydrophone Locator system. This tells PAMGuard how to calculate the actual positions 
of the individual hydrophones from the streamer origin. Moored hydrophones generally use a rigid locator, whereas towed 
hydrophones are usually better off using a threading hydrophone locator which will give more accurate hydrophone 
positions as the vessel turns a corner. 
</p>
<p>A single array can mix streamers of different types.</p>
<p>Several different arrays may be managed and stored, although only one is loaded at any one time.</p>

<p>Each array may contain up to 32 individual hydrophone
elements (transducers).</p>

<p>A one-to-many relationship exists between hydrophones and
software channels.</p>

<p>Each hydrophone element must be assigned to a streamer. The
actual coordinates for each hydrophone used by PAMGuard are the sum of
the streamer coordinates and the individual hydrophone element
coordinates. Although this appears to introduce some redundancy
regarding the coordinates of each hydrophone, streamer assignment is
important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the errors on the relative
locations of pairs of hydrophones to be more accurately defined (the
errors between hydrophones in different streamers will generally be
greater than the errors on a hydrophone in the same streamer). Secondly,
should a streamer be moved or shortened, it is easier to adjust the
coordinates of a single streamer than to adjust the coordinates of all
hydrophones individually.</p>

 

<h3>The Default Array</h3>
<p>The first time you run PAMGuard, a default array consisting of
two hydrophone elements spaced 3m apart at 5m depth, 100m and 103m
astern of the vessel. Channels in the array are mapped 1:1 to ADC
channels 0 and 1.</p>
