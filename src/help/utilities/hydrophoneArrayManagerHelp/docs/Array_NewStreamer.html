<h1>Hydrophone Array</h1>
<h2>New Streamer Dialog</h2><br>

The Streamer dialog has changed in release 1.13. 
<p>

<p>The Streamer name is for information purposes only. </p>

<h3>Reference Position</h3>
<p>Streamer locations can be referenced to either the "Ships GPS Data" or to "Fixed location (moorings and buoys)". 
If GPS data is selected then the system will automatically connect to data from the 
<a href="../../../mapping/NMEA/docs/ConfiguringGPS.html">GPS Module</a>. If a fixed location is selected, then 
additional options will appear allowing you to enter a reference Latitude and Longitude.  
</p>
<img alt="Image" src="./Images/FixedStreamer.png"/><br>
<p>To change the position, use the menu on the button to the right of the displayed location. It is possible 
to enter a new value manually, take the current GPS position or to paste in the last location clicked on the 
<a href="../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html">PAMGuard map</a>.
<br>
<h3>Hydrophone Locator Method</h3>
<p>Two methods are available for calculating true hydrophone coordinates from the reference position. These are 
the "Threading Streamer" locator and the "Straight / Rigid Streamer" locator.</p>
<p>The Threading system is most applicable to towed hydrophone systems referenced to ship GPS data. It assumes that 
the streamer cable exactly follows the track of the vessel as it goes round corners. However, for hydrophones mounted
rigidly on the hull of a vessel it would be more sensible to use the Straight / Rigid method. </p>
<p>If the reference position is a fixed location, then it only makes sense to use the Straight / Rigid method.</p>
<br>
<h3>Hydrophone Coordinates</h3>
<p>Enter the hydrophone coordinates  in metres relative to the reference position. </p>
<p>Also enter estimates of the errors on those coordinates.</p>

<h3>Orientation data</h3>
<p>For GPS referenced locations, if these values are not null, they will override heading values from the GPS data. If they are null, 
then the GPS values will be used.  
Some users are starting to collect orientation data for hydrophones which can give a more accurate 
position than relying on the threading hydrophone model. No systems for collecting these data are yet built 
into PAMGuard and have to date only been imported during offline analysis of data. Expect further developments in this 
area in the near future !</p>

<br>
<h3>Interpolation</h3>
<p>Things sometimes move ! As we start to incorporate sensors into our arrays, it will be necessary to chose how to pick 
a position from a list of evolving positions over time.</p><p>These options tell the system to take the latest value entered by the user, 
to interpolate between values bracketing the time of an event or to use the values immediately preceding an event.<p>
