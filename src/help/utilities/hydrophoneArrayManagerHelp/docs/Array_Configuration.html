<h1>Hydrophone Array</h1>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p><br>
The array configuration dialog is now opened from the <em><strong>Settings>Hydrophone
array</strong></em> menu.</p>
<p><img alt="Hydrophone array dialog"
	src="./Images/ArrayConfiguration.png" /><br>
<br></p>

<p>The array dialog is divided into five distinct regions.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sec1">1) Hydrophone Positions</a></i> <br>Provides a graphical display of the
hydrophone positions within the array. </p>

<p><i><a href="#sec2">2) Array Configuration</a></i><br> Lists the individual streamers and hydrophone
elements making up the array.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sec3">3) Channel Configuration</a></i><br> Lists the software channels
associated with a <a href="../../sound_processing.AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">Sound Acquisition Module.</a>.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sec4">4) Environment</a></i><br> Lists environmental parameters.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sec5">5) Array Management</a></i><br> Allows you to create, import, export and
rename different hydrophone arrays.</p>

<h3><a name="sec1"></a>Hydrophone Positions</h3>
<p>This part of the dialog is for information purposes only and
there are no configuration options. Hydrophone positions are shown relative 
to the reference coordinate and heading. Physical hydrophone numbers are
shown in black. Software channel numbers are shown in red. It is
possible, if no software channel is connected to a particular hydrophone
that the software channel will be absent for some hydrophones.</p>
<p><i>Coordinate Frame</i>
<br>For towed systems it is assumed that the vessel's GPS is at (x,y) = (0,0) and is travelling
in the forward (increasing) y direction. Consequently, for an array
towed astern of the vessel, y coordinates are generally negative
numbers. For a single array in the centre line of the vessel with a
centrally mounted GPS, all x coordinates will be zero, etc. For display
purposes, depth is entered as a positive number, however developers
should be aware that within the PAMGuard data model, the positive z
coordinate is upwards, therefore depths are stored as negative numbers.
</p>
<p>For fixed locations, the diagram is relative to the heading set for that mooring, 
which should be an angle relative to True North. If no heading is set, the angles are relative to True North. </p> 
<br>
<h3><a name="sec2"></a>Array Configuration</h3>
<p>This lists the individual streamers and hydrophone elements making up an array.
</p>
<p><i>Selecting an array</i>
<br>If more than one array is available within a configuration, a
particular array may be selected using the drop down list. Note that
only one array is loaded at any one time.</p>
<p><i>Hydrophone Streamers</i><br>
If you are using a towed array you should define one or more streamers which will
be shown in the Hydrophone Streamers table.</p>
<p>A Streamer is used to refer to any cluster of hydrophones which share a common 
origin, e.g. a towed array or a buoy of some sort would normally be entered as a single
streamer containing one or more hydrophones. </p>
<p>Use the Add, Edit and Delete buttons to add, edit and delete streamers. When you 
add or edit a streamer the <a href="Array_NewStreamer.html">Streamer Dialog</a> will appear
which allows you to set up the streamer coordinates and other properties.</p>
<p>You will not be able to remove the last streamer. You will also only be able to delete a streamer 
if no hydrophones are associated with that streamer. </p>

<p><i>Hydrophone Elements</i><br>
<p>This area lists individual hydrophone elements. Each hydrophone is given a unique Id which is referred to in the
Channel Configuration section and is also associated with a single hydrophone streamer.</p>
<p>Use the Add, Edit and Delete buttons to add, edit and delete hydrophones. When you 
add or edit a hydrophone the <a href="Array_NewHydrophone.html">Hydrophone Dialog</a> will appear.</p>


<h3><a name="sec3"></a>Channel Configuration</h3>
<p>The first stage of most PAM processes is to acquire the sound
with a digitiser (e.g. a <a
	href="../../../sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">sound
card</a>) or some other Sound Acquisition module within the PAMGuard model.
</p>
<p>It is possible for PAMGuard to operate with more than one Sound
Acquisition module and a one-to-many relationship can exist between
hydrophones and data channels within the sound acquisition modules. For
instance, a single multi-element array may contain both low and high
frequency hydrophones, some of which are connected to a low frequency
digitiser and other high frequency hydrophones.</p>
<p>The drop down list at the top of the Channel Configuration panel
will list all Sound Acquisition Modules currently instantiated in the
PAMGuard data model. Information on a single Sound Acquisition module is
displayed at any one time.</p>
<p>By default, when a sound acquisition module is created, it will
map it's channels 1 to 1 to the PAMGuard array. To change these
mappings, select the software channel of interest in the Channel
Configuration panel and press 'Change hydrophone' and select the
hydrophone you want to relate to that software channel.</p>
<p>Other parameters displayed in the list area of the Channel
Configuration panel are set in the Sound Acquisition dialog and are for
information only.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="sec4"></a>Environment</h3>
<p>This currently contains the speed of sound in sea water and an estimate of
the error on the speed of sound measurement.</p>
<p>(It is possible that future releases of PAMGuard will allow entry
of a sound speed profile here ).</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="sec5"></a>Array Management</h3>
<p>When you have finished with the PAMGuard Hydrophone Array dialog,
press the <em><strong>OK </strong></em>button.</p>
<p>To exit without saving changes, press<em><strong>
Cancel</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Other buttons perform the following actions:</p>
<p><strong>New Array</strong>: Creates a new PAMGuard
hydrophone array</p>
<p><strong>Copy</strong>: Copies the currently loaded array</p>
<p><strong>Rename</strong>: Renames the currently loaded
array</p>
<p><strong>Import</strong>: Imports a hydrophone array from a
PAMGuard Array File (.paf)</p>
<p><strong>Export</strong>: Exports the currently selected
array to a PAMGuard Array File (.paf)</p>
<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Deletes the currently selected
array.</p>
