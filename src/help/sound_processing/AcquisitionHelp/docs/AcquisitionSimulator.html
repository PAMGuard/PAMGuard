<h1>Simulated Sources</h1>
<p>PAMGuard can simulate data for a variety of different sound types from one or 
multiple sources.</p>
<p>Simulated data are useful in training and are can be used by developers to 
test detection and localisation algorithms.</p>

<br>
<h2>Setting up simulated sources</h2>
<p>In the data acquisition dialog select "Simulated Sources" 
as the Data Source Type.</p> 
<p>The dialog will then show a panel where you can create and alter 
any number of simulated objects. </p>

<h3>Background Noise</h3>
<p>Background noise is simulated with a flat spectrum. Enter the spectrum level 
background noise level in dB re.1&mu;Pa/&radic;Hz.</p>

<h3>Propagation Model</h3>
<p>Two very simple propagation models are currently available. These are Spherical Spreading 
and Spherical Spreading with a surface echo. If the latter is selected, the sea surface is
assumed to be a perfect reflector. <p>It is possible that more sophisticated models
will be added in the future.</p>


<h3>Creating and editing Simulated Objects</h3>
<p>You can Add, Copy Remove and Edit objects in the simulated objects table 
using the buttons situated below the list of simulated objects.</p> 
<p>If you Add, Copy, or Edit an object, the following dialog will appear</p>

<p>The location for a new source is set at the current vessel position. Although it 
is possible to edit these positions here, it is easier to drag them to the desired 
location on the map display using the mouse. </p>
<p>Give the sound source a name, select the sound type and set the signal amplitude in 
dB re.1&mu;Pa p-p.</p>
<p>Set the interval between successive sounds. If you check the 'Randomise' box, intervals
will be selected at random between 0 and twice the Mean Interval. Otherwise, sounds will be regularly 
spaced in time. Note that the first one or each sound will always be generated at a random start time
so that regular sounds with the same interval do not always perfectly coincide.</p>  
<p>You can also set the source depth, course and speed over ground.</p>
 


<h3>Processing speed and listening to simulated data</h3>
<p>If no <a href="../../soundPlaybackHelp/docs/soundPlayback_soundPlayback.html">Sound Playback</a>
 module is included in the PAMGuard configuration, or if no channels are
selected in the <a href="../../soundPlaybackHelp/docs/soundPlayback_soundPlayback.html">Sound Playback</a> 
module, then simulated data will be analysed as fast as possible, 
which could be considerably faster than real time.</p>
<p>If a <a href="../../soundPlaybackHelp/docs/soundPlayback_soundPlayback.html">Sound playback</a> 
module is present and is in use, then analysis will run in real time and you will 
be able to hear the sounds being played back from the computers sound card</p>.
