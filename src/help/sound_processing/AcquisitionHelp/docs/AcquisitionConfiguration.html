	<h1>Sound Acquisition Configuration</h1>
	<p>
		To access the module's settings, select <em><strong>Detection>Sound
				Acquisition... </strong></em> from the main menu and click on the name of your
		module. This will bring up an Audio Data Acquisition dialogue similar
		to the one shown below.
	</p>

	</center>
	<p></p>
	<br>
	<p>The dialog is divided into four separate regions. the
		information in each region may vary depending on the type of input
		device you are using.</p>

	<h3>Data Source Type</h3>
	<p>From the drop down list, select the type of input device you
		wish to use. Different input devices offer different numbers of
		channels, sample rates and quality of data. For many applications
		using just two channels of data in the human audio band, a standard
		sound card is adequate, but for higher sample rates, or higher numbers
		of channels, ASIO sound cards or National Instruments Data Acquisition
		devices may be required</p>
	<p>
		Note that not all input types are supported on all platforms.<br>

	<h3>Select audio line (or specific input device or file)</h3>
	<p>The information displayed here will vary depending on the type
		of Data Source. Please refer to instructions on specific data source
		configuration.</p>

	<h3>Sampling</h3>
	<p>The information displayed here will vary depending on the type
		of Data Source. Please refer to instructions on specific data source
		configuration.</p>

	<h3>Calibration</h3>
	<p>The peak to peak voltage range of the device and the
		preamplifier gain are used by some PAMGuard modules to calculate
		absolute received signal levels in dB re. 1&mu Pa. For some devices,
		this information may be filled in automatically, for others you will
		need to enter it yourself. If you don't know the input sensitivity of
		your device, don't worry, PAMGuard will run, but amplitudes may not be
		accurate.</p>
		<p>If your sound acquisition system has a DC offset in it (many do), tick 
the 'Subtract DC ...' button and enter a time constant. A single pole high pass filter will then be applied to all incoming data.</p>
	
<p>(Note that the 'Bandwidth' field has been removed since it was not used in any way)</p>
