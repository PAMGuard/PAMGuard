<h1>Asio Sound Cards</h1>
<p>Many sound cards are provided with two sets of drivers, the 'normal ones' which 
make the card operate using the normal system sound card drivers (see
<a href="AcquisitionSoundCard.html">Sound Cards</a>) and ASIO drivers which were
developed by <a href="http://www.steinberg.net/en/home.html">Steinberg</a> for 
professional studio applications.</p> 
<p>The advantages of using ASIO drivers are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They support more than two input channels.</li>
<li><p>They don't perform unnecessary sample rate conversions.</li>
<li><p>They don't mess with your audio data in any way whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
</p><br>
<h2>Setting up an Asio sound card</h2>
<p>
In the data acquisition dialog select "Asio Sound Card" 
as the Data Source Type and a list of available Asio sound cards will appear in the 
drop down list under the title "Select Audio Line". Select the card you with to use.
</p>
<h3>Channel Configuration</h3>
<p>Asio sound cards often support data acquisition from more than two channels.</p>
<p>The number of available channels (and the quality of the data) will of course
still vary from card to card.</p> 
<p>Another very important feature is that you can define which channels you want 
to read out by mapping the hardware channels on the device to software channels in
PAMGuard</p>
<p>When you select an Asio sound card, the 'Sampling' section of the acquisition 
dialog will expand to show a set of drop down boxes, the bumber of boxes corresponding to 
the number of channels you are reading out:</p>

<p>For each software channel, select the hardware channel you wish to use.</p>
<p><strong>Note that PAMGuard channel numbering starts at 0. Your hardware channel numbering may start at 1.
So be aware. If you've put a plug into socket 1, you probably want to select channel 0, etc.</strong></p>
