<h1>File Time Options</h1>
<h2>File Times</h2>
<p>PAMGuard will attempt to automatically derive a date and time from audio file names. While we have programmed in a large number
of different time and date formats, we cannot capture them all so it's sometimes necessary to tell PAMGuard exactly how to extract date
and time information from a file name. Characters (a-z) and be stripped automatically, but problems arise if other numbers are present.</p>
<p>An example of names that can't be unpacked automatically might be</p>
<p>1677738025.180912073628.d24.d8.wav</p>
<p>The actual date is 12 September 2018 at 07:36:28. however it is impossible for PAMGuard to work out that the date information is between
the second and third '.' characters and that the rest of the name should be ignored.</p> 
<p>To define your own file format, select 'User defined date format' then in the format field, enter a set of characters that will tell PAMGuard
how to unpack the information.</p> 

<p>For every character in the file name that is NOT part of the date, enter the # character. The number of # must exactly match 
the number of characters preceding the date part of the name. Leading and trailing non numeric characters will also be stripped automatically 
after characters corresponding to a # have been removed.</p> 

<p>For the date section, Java lays down strict rules for how each character should be represented details of 
which are <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">here</a> and below. 
Note that most of these are case sensitive. </p>

<p>When entering a data format, be very careful. For instance 'hh' will be interpreted as a 12 hour time format, which 
will lead to errors. 'HH' is the correct character sequence for 24 hour time. Also be very careful of the difference between
'MM' for month and 'mm' for minutes, and between lower case 'ss' for seconds and upper case 'SSS' for milliseconds.</p>
 
<p>The table below shows all available format specifiers. The ones you're most likely to use are highlighted in bold type</p>

<h2>Time Zone</h2>
<p>Ideally, all PAMGuard data should be referenced to UTC, this makes it easy to align with GPS data and data from other sources.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is necessary to process audio files which do not have a UTC based time encoded in their file name, but are referenced to some other time zone.</p>
<p>The File Date Settings dialog allows you to set the time zone and any additional time offsets for an audio file or set of audio files.</p>


<p>The time zone offset and optional daylight saving will be SUBTRACTED from the time value extracted from the file name.</p>
<p>The additional time offset will be ADDED to the time value extracted from the file name.</p>
<p>Check and double check that the time extracted from the file and corrected for time zone and offset is correct before
processing sound file data.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/SoundTrapClickDetector.html">additional notes</a> 
	on SUD file times if you're processing Soundtrap data.</p>
