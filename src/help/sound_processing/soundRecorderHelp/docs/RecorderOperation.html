<h1>Sound Recorder</h1>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<br>

<h3>Off</h3>
<p>If the <em><strong>Off</strong></em> button is highlighted, then only triggered recordings will be made.</p>
<h3>Automatic Cycle</h3>
<p>Pressing the <em><strong>Automatic Cycle</strong></em> button causes the recorder to start recording for specified durations
  at predefined time intervals.</p>
<h3>Continuous</h3>
<p>Pressing the <em><strong>Continuous</strong></em> button will start continuous recording. File lengths will never exceed 
  the maximum set in the Options dialog. If a new file is started automatically, then no data will
  be lost and there will be no gap if you should join the files together again, or analyse them
  as a single file at a later date.</p>
<h3>Continuous + Buffer</h3>
<p>Pressing the <em><strong>Continuous + Buffer</strong></em> button will have the same effect as the Continuous button, but the 
  buffer contents will be written at the start of the file and the file name will reflect the start time
  of the recording (i.e. some time before the button was pressed).</p>
<h3>Triggered Recording</h3>
<p>Some detectors are capable of automatically triggering recording. The instructions that do 
  this are hard coded into individual detectors. Detectors that trigger recordings will have a time
  to record from <i>prior</i> to the detection (using the buffer system as used with Continuous + 
  Buffer manual recordings) and a time to record for after the detection. If multiple detections
  occur with the set recording times, recording will simply continue. These times may be hard coded
  in specific detectors or may be controllable by the user via menu items associated with the 
  detectors in question.
</p>
<p>
Triggered recording may be enabled and disabled for individual detectors using the check boxes
on the main Sound Recorder display panel.  

<h3>Side Panel</h3>
<p>The four main control buttons and status display are duplicated in a side panel 
  for ease of operation.

  If a database module is active in the PAMGUARD model, then AIS data will be logged to the database
