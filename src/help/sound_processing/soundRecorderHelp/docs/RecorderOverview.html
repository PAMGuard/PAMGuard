<h1>Sound Recorder</h1>
<h2> Overview</h2>
<br>

<p>
The sound recorder may be used to make WAV or AIF file recordings to the computer's
hard drive. <br>

<br>
Recording can be continuous, or the recorder can be scheduled to make fixed length
recordings at set time intervals. The recorder can also be set up to be triggered
by any PAMGuard detectors so that recordings are made only when detections occur.
<p>
The recorder also contains a memory buffer so that sounds heard by the operator, or sounds which trigger
detectors can be captured without having to record continuously.  
<p>
The most obvious source of data for the sound recorder is a sound acquisition module, but it 
is also possible to connect a sound recorder to many other PAMGuard processes that produce
raw data, including <a href="../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">Decimators</a>
and <a href="../../FiltersHelp/Docs/Filters_filters.html">Filters</a>. More than one Recorder can be configured if necessary.
