	<h1>Noise Band Measurement</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
		PAMGuard contains two modules which can measure noise levels in
		multiple frequency bands. These are called the <a
			href=NoiseBandsFFT.html>Noise Monitor</a> and the <a
			href=NoiseBandsFilters.html>Noise Band Monitor</a>, both available
		from the <em>File / Add Modules / Sound Processing</em> menu.
	</p>
	<p>Both modules should give the same results to within a fraction
		of a Decibel, so which you use is largely up to you. however, there
		are some subtle differences.</p>
	<p>The Noise Monitor module works using FFT data as input. The
		resolution of the noise measurements in both time and frequency is
		therefore governed by how you've set up the FFF. For example, if
		you've data with a sample rate of 48kHz and are using a FFT length of
		1024 samples, then the frequency resolution of the FFT will be
		48000/1024 = 46.9Hz. Since the measurements are made by adding up
		multiple bins of data from the FFT's, you can't get a sensible
		measurement below a frequency bin size of about 200Hz. Further, the
		FFT time intervals may not align nicely with exact seconds, so the
		intervals between measurements may be a bit longer than you've asked
		for.</p>
	<p>The Noise Band Monitor works differently, using a bank of
		filters to process the incoming raw data and these filters can go as
		low in frequency as you like, and take measurements from the data at
		the exat times you've asked for. On the other hand, the filter banks
		are slow to process, so this module will take more resources on your
		computer than the FFT based method.</p>
	<p>The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are laid out
		below</p>
