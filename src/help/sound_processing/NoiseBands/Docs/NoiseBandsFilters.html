	<h1>Noise Band Measurement</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>This module allows you to measure noise in 
	frequency bands of different widths: Octave, Third Octave, Deci-Decade, Decade, 1/10 Octave, and 1/12 Octave. 
	These measurements are compatible with the ANSI Standard 
	<a href = "https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/asa/ansiasas1112004r2009">
	ANSI S1.11-2004 American National Standard Specification for
Octave-Band and Fractional-Octave-Band Analog and Digital Filters</a>.
	</p>
	<p>The method works by first measuring noise noise bands the highest octave 
	of the available data using a bank of band pass filters. The data are then decimated
	 by a factor 2 (or 10 for Decade bands) and a further set of measurements made in the next octave down
	(i.e. the highest octave of the decimated data). This process can be repeated for as many decimators /
	octaves of data that you wish, reaching lower and lower frequencies. Because the amount of raw data to be processed
	is halved in each decimator, each bank of filters requires increasingly less processing power. </p>

	<h3>Creating the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the <em><strong>File>Add modules>Sound Processing</strong></em>
		menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select "<em><strong>
				Noise Band Monitor</strong></em>". Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Configuring the module</h3>
	<p>
		To configure the module, open the settings dialog from the <em><strong>Detection>"your
				module name" </strong></em> menu:
	</p>

	<br>
	<h4>Raw Data Source</h4>
	<p>
		Select a source of raw data. This will generally be a <a
			href="../../AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">
			Sound Acquisition Module</a> or the output of a <a
			href="../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">
			Decimator</a> if a lower frequency noise measurement is required. Check
		the channels you want to measure noise on.
	</p>

	<h4>Output Interval</h4>
	<p>Enter the interval between measurements in seconds.</p>

	<h4>Measurement Bands</h4>
	<p>Select the band type you wish to measure in from the drop down list, and the Reference Frequency, which is the centre 
	frequency of a band, against which all other band centres will be calculated. By default, this is 1000Hz. </p>
	 
	<p>Select the maximum and minimum frequencies you want to measure between. Bands will then be calculated to fit between these 
	limits, i.e. the upper edge of the highest band will not be greater than the maximum frequency and the lower edge of the lowest band
	will not be lower than the minimum frequency. e.g. if you are working with third octave bands and set the frequency limits to be 200Hz and 24kHz, 
	you'll get 20 bands between 222.7Hz and 22.63kHz.
	</p>
	

	<h4>Filters</h4>
	<p>Select Butterworth or IIR Filters. Generally, Butterworth filters will operate much faster than FIR filters on a 
	desktop computer. Generally 6th order Butterworth or 7th oder (128 tap) FIR filters are more than adequate. 
	The exact cut off frequencies and filter responses are shown for information only. 
	</p>
	
<br>
	<h4>Bode Plots</h4>
	<p>The filter responses and the responses of the decimators are shown in the Bode plot on the right
	hand side of the dialog. It is also possible to overlay the various ANSI standards. The scale of the 
	amplitude axis can be altered by double clicking on it.
