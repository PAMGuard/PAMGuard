	<h1>Noise Band Measurement</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>This module allows you to measure noise in 
	frequency bands of  Third Octave, Deci-Decade, or bands you type in yourself. 
	These measurements are compatible with the ANSI Standard 
	<a href = "https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/asa/ansiasas1112004r2009">
	ANSI S1.11-2004 American National Standard Specification for
Octave-Band and Fractional-Octave-Band Analog and Digital Filters</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>The module required FFT data as input. It works out which FFT data belong to 
	which of the defined frequency bands, and as data arrive, sums the FFT data for
	each band. This means that at low frequencies, where the frequency bands your measuring
	are probably smaller, you start to lose resolution in frequency. If you want to measure noise 
	at very low frequencies, you'll either have to use a very long FFT length, or switch to 
	using the <a href=NoiseBandsFilters.html>Noise Band Monitor</a>. </p> 
	
	
	<h3>Creating the module</h3>
	<p>
		From the <em><strong>File>Add modules>Sound Processing</strong></em>
		menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select "<em><strong>
				Noise Monitor</strong></em>". Enter a name for the new module and press Ok.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Configuring the module</h3>
	<p>
		To configure the module, open the settings dialog from the <em><strong>Detection>"your
				module name" </strong></em> menu:

	<h4>Output Interval</h4>
	<p>Enter the interval between measurements in seconds. Note that you may not get measurements at exactly these intervals
	because the start times of the FFT data may not like exactly on second boundaries.</p>
	

	
	<h4>Number of measures in interval</h4>
	<p>Generally, it's best to select the 'Use all FFT data button, so that all data in all FFT's in the selected time 
	interval will be included in noise measurement. However, if you're intervals are very long and you want to reduce processing
	load by only using a random sample of the data, you can set a lower number of measurement to take from that interval.<p>
