<h1>Seismic Veto</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2><br>
<p>Many of the PAMGuard detectors set detection thresholds
automatically as a function of background noise. Loud sounds from
airguns can upset this automatic threshold setting. It is of course
extremely unpleasant listening on headphones when airguns are firing
nearby and airgun sounds may even pose a risk to the operators hearing.
</p>
<p>During automatic threshold setting, a period of zero signal can
upset threshold levels almost as much as a period of too much signal for
some detector types</p>
<p>The seismic veto module detects the airgun pulse automatically
using a simple in-band energy detector operating on spectrogram data.
When the signal level exceeds some threshold, that period of sound is
either taken out and set to zero, or replaced with randomly generated
noise with the same spectral properties as measured in the signal prior
to the airgun pulse. The time window of vetoed data can be set to
continue after the signal has fallen below threshold to ensure the end
of the pulse is discarded. It can also be configured to start the veto
before the onset of the pulse (this is achieved by delaying the signal
slightly in an internal buffer).</p>
<p>The seismic veto module has two output streams, the first
containing vetoed FFT data and the second containing vetoed raw audio
data. Other PAMGuard modules can subscribe to the appropriate output of
the seismic veto module and operate as normal, but without the loud
airgun sounds.</p>

<p>The figure above shows a simple PAMGuard configuration with the output
of the seismic veto connected to a

sound playback module</a>, a click
detector and a whistle detector. The figure below shows spectrograms and
waveforms of data before and after the seismic veto module.</p>

<p>A veto can be inserted anywhere in the PAMGuard data model
where there is
