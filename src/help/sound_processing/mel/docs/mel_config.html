	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	<br>

	<p>
		To configure the Mel Spectrogram, , go to the <em><strong>Detection>"your
				module name" settings ..."</strong></em> menu.
	</p>

	<p>
		Select the FFT data source from the drop-down list at the top of the
		dialog. If no FFT sources are available, you'll have to add a <a
			href="../../../sound_processing/fftManagerHelp/docs/FFTEngine_Overview.html">FFT
			module</a>.
	</p>
	<p>The main parameters of the FFT module are displayed in the
		middle panel. Of these, the most important is the Frequency
		Resolution, since you can't make Mels with a finer resolution than
		that which exists in the FFT module.</p>
		<p>Set the frequency range and number of Mels. The lowest frequency must be
		greater than 0, and should probably be bigger than the FFT frequency resolution. 
		The smallest step between frequencies in the Mels is shown at the bottom of the panel. 
		This should also be larger than the FFT frequency resolution, otherwise, all your Mels will
		be sampling exactly the same FFT data.</p>
		<p>Set the 'power' this is the power that samples from the FFT data will be raised to as they
		are summed into each Mel frequency bin.</p>
<p>When you OK the dialog, it will issue a warning if the configuration of the Mels includes frequencies
that are simply to small and close together to make any sense. If requried, you can change the frequency 
range of the Mel Spectrogram, the number of Mels, or adjust the FFT parameters - a larger FFT Length will 
give a finer frequency resolution, but a courser time resolution.</p>
