<h1>Patch Panel</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2><br>
<p>Patch Panels can be used to re-order channels, duplicate channels and mix data 
from multiple channels</p>

<p>
A patch panel can be inserted anywhere in the PAMGuard data model 
where there are raw audio data. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Creating a Patch Panel</h3>

<p>
From the <strong><em>File>Add modules>Sound Processing</em></strong> menu, or from the pop-up menu on the 
data model display select "<strong><em>Patch Panel</em></strong>". 
Enter a name for the new Patch Panel module (or keep the default "Patch Panel") 
and press Ok.</p>
<br>

<h3>Configure the Patch Panel</h3>
<p>The Patch Panel module requires a source of raw data before it can operate. 
This may come directly from a 
<a href="../../AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">Sound Acquisition module</a> (e.g. a sound card 
or a National Instruments board) 
or from processed data such as the output from a 
<a href="../../FiltersHelp/Docs/Filters_filters.html">filter</a>, a 
<a href="../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">decimator</a>, etc. 
</p>
<p>
To configure the Patch Panel, go to the <strong><em>Detection>"your patch panel name ...">
menu </em></strong></p>
<br>
<img alt="Patch Panel Dialog" src="Images/PatchPanel.png"/><br>
<p>
Select the data source at the top of the dialog.
</p> 

<h3>Patch Panel Settings</h3>
<p>
Inputs to the patch panel are shown down the left hand side of the matrix. The number
of inputs will be equal to the number of channels in the data source. 
</p>
<p>Outputs are shown along the top. There will always be 32 output channels available.</p>
<p> Check the boxes to link input channels to output channels.</p>
<p>In the example, the patch panel has been used to reverse the order of channels 2 and 3.</p>

<h3>Apply Immediately</h3>
<p>If the "Apply Immediately" box is checked, then changes to the patch panel matrix
become effective immediately.</p>
