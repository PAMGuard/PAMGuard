<h1>Map</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Map purpose</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the map is to provide detection and
localisation information graphically. <br>
<br>
<b><font color="#ff0000">The PAMGuard map should not, on any account, be
used as a tool for navigation.</font></b></p>
<br>

<h3>Map tab panel</h3>

<p>The map is viewed by clicking on the Map tab panel.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

This tab display consists of the map itself (left), a map control panel
(upper right) and an information display (lower right). The main map
graphics are: labeled lines of latitude and longitude, an icon for the
vessel hosting the PAMGuard GPS and depth/coast contours.<br>
<br>
Detection event graphics can be overlaid on the map by right clicking
and selecting the desired overlay type. Further map options can be set
from the Map menu item.</p>

<h3>Map Comments</h3>
<p>Annotations can be added to the map by double clicking anywhere with the 
mouse.</p><p>A dialog will then appear with the time and position (latitude and 
longitude) of where the mouse was clicked already filled in.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/mapcomment.png" alt="map comment"><br>
<br>
<p>The operator can then type in a comment which will be stored in the database
and a symbol will be displayed on the map, the comment being shown whenever 
the mouse is hovered over the symbol. </p>
