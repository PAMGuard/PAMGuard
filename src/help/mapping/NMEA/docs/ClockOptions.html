<h2>Update PC Clock</h2>

Administrator rights</b></center></p>

<p><br>
  Accurate timing is critical to many survey and mitigation exercises. </p>
<p>
All timing within PAMGuard uses the Universal Time Code (equivalent to GMT) which is read
from the PC clock. <p>
The PC Clock should be set from the GPS, which receives an accurate time stamp
from satellites.  <p>
Select the menu <em><strong>Detection>GPS>Update PC Clock</strong></em> to open the dialog
<p>

The upper text area shows the current PC time. When GPS data are received, the correct time
will be printed in the lower text area and you are given the option of setting the PC clock from 
the GPS data. 
<p>
Check <strong>"Auto set on PAMGuard start-up"</strong> and the PC clock will automatically be set
from the GPS each time PAMGuard starts.
<h4>Time Zones</h4>
<p>Note that PAMGuard sets and reads the PC clock in such as way that the local time, 
  (for instance, as shown in the Windows task bar) may show a time different to UTC as governed
  by the time zone and daylight savings settings of your computer. Don't worry - this is perfectly normal.
  The correct UTC time as used by PAMGuard is clearly visible on the GUI display. Setting the PC clock by hand 
  from the control panel is likely to set the incorrect UTC in the machine.</p>
