	<h2>Update PC Clock</h2>

	<p>
		<br> Accurate timing is critical to many survey and mitigation
		exercises.
	</p>
	<p>All timing within PAMGuard uses the Universal Time Code
		(equivalent to GMT) which is read from the PC clock.
	<p>The PC Clock can be set from the GPS, which receives an accurate
		time stamp from satellites.
	<p>
		Select the menu <em><strong>Detection>GPS>Update PC
				Clock</strong></em> to open the dialog
	<p>

		<br> The upper text area shows the current PC time. When GPS data
		are received, the correct time will be printed in the lower text area
		and you are given the option of setting the PC clock from the GPS
		data.
	<p>
		Check <strong>"Auto set on PAMGuard start-up"</strong> and the PC
		clock will automatically be set from the GPS each time PAMGuard
		starts. Time Zones
	<h3></h3>
	<p>Note that PAMGuard sets and reads the PC clock in such as way
		that the local time, (for instance, as shown in the Windows task bar)
		may show a time different to UTC as governed by the time zone and
		daylight savings settings of your computer. Don't worry - this is
		perfectly normal. The correct UTC time as used by PAMGuard is clearly
		visible on the GUI display. Setting the PC clock by hand from the
		control panel is likely to set the incorrect UTC in the machine.</p>

	<h3>Windows Security Settings</h3>
	<p>Since Windows 10, it has not been possible to automatically
		update the PC clock from PAMGuard unless you make some small changes
		to the Windows security settings. This needs to be done by someone
		with Administrator privileges on the PC, but only needs to be done
		once.</p>
