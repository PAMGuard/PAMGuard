The airgun display configuration dialog is accessed from the 
  <em>  <strong>Display>AIS Ship Reporting>Display Options</strong></em>... menu command.

<p>
  The two pieces of information required to correctly position the guns are</p>
<ol><p></p>
  <li>
    <p><b>The Source Vessel Identification</b><br>
      This is either the vessel PAMGuard is running on, in which case
      the gun position will be relative to the GPS receiver plugged into PAMGuard, or it can be 
      another vessel in which case the guns' positions will be calculated relative to the 
      GPS receiver feeding the AIS transponder on that vessel. If the guns are on another vessel, you will need to know the vessel's 
      Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number and input it to the 
      AIS Display dialog. You can get this either from the AIS data listed within 
  PAMGuard, or ask the vessel's captain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>The location of the airgun array </b><br>
      This is in the form of two coordinates relative to the GPS receiver feeding 
      PAMGuard or the GPS receiver feeding the AIS transponder on a different vessel. </p>
  </li>
</ol></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Mitigation Zone</h3>
<p>You may also enter a mitigation zone, which is a simple circle of fixed radius around 
  the airgun location. 
</p>
<p>
You may also enter a predicted mitigation zone which will display the area on the PAMGuard 
map which will fall within the mitigation zone within the specified time period.<br><br>
