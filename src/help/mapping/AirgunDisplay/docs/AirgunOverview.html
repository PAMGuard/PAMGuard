<h1>Airgun Display</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2><br>

<p>
During mitigation exercises, it is often required to know the locations of detections relative to an airgun array. 
<p>
PAMGuard can display the locations of airguns, and the extent of a specified mitigation zone around the guns. 
<p>
Airgun locations can be set relative to the <a href=../../NMEA/docs/ConfiguringGPS.html">GPS receiver</a> 
of the vessel running PAMGuard or relative to 
the <a href="../../AIS/docs/AISOverview.html">AIS data</a> received from one or more different vessels.  <br><br>
