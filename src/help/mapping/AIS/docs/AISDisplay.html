<h1>AIS</h1>
<h2>AIS Display</h2><br>

<p>
AIS Data can be displayed on the <a href="../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html">PAMGuard map</a>. Vessels 
are displayed along with an optional heading arrow. Hovering the mouse over a vessel will bring up a 
window displaying further information about the vessel.

<p>A full list of recent AIS data can be viewed from the Display>AIS Ship Reporting>Show all Ship Data.
Note that so called "static" data, such as the vessel name, type, cargo and destination are transmitted
less often than position course and speed information. It is therefore not unusual to see AIS data items 
which only have basic position information. Cargo and Destination information accuracy is also highly 
dependent on each vessels master keeping that information up to date.
