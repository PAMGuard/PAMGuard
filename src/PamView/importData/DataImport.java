/**
 * This class is used to define what data to import and how to import it. It is
 * used in conjunction with ImportDataSystem to create a generic system to load
 * any type of data into a data block.
 * <p>
 * First getExtensionsStrings() defines which file types can be selected for
 * import.
 * <p>
 * Before loading in any data we need to perform pre-checks with the function
 * performPreChecks(). This function is called before the load thread is called.
 * Often this will remain blank but say you needed extra user imput then this
 * function could be used to create another dialog box before the data is
 * loaded.
 * <p>
 * To create a new importer first we need to load a file into memory using the
 * loadDataIntermediate(String filePath) function. This will create an
 * ArrayList<T> were T is the type of data we're trying to save. So for example
 * if you are loading in NMEA data then you would use create
 * loadDataIntermediate(String filePath) which imports the file (filepath) and
 * converts into an ArrayList of strings io.e ArrayList<String> such that
 * T=String;
 * <p>
 * Once the data has been loaded into memory it must be converted into a data
 * unit and saved to a data block. The function createDataUnit(T dataLine)
 * converts data into a PamDatUnit. This function would for example, convert an
 * NMEA strings into a GPSDataUnit. The function isDataFormatOK() needs to be
 * used to check that each T is in the correct format.
 * <p>
