# Matched click classifier

## Overview

The matched click classifier is an alternative to the in built click classifier in the click detection module which uses two click templates (target and reject) to classify individual clicks detections from the click detection module. The idea behind this classifier is to more accurately classify rarer clicks when there 

## How it works

The classifier is based on a matched filter i.e. a candidate click detection is compared to a template and it's maximum correlation value with the template is then used for classification. Each click is compared to both a _match_ and a _reject_ template. If the difference between the correlation match to the reject template exceeds a certain threshold, then the click is classified. There can be multiple combinations of match to reject templates allowing the matched classifier to deal with different types of clicks or even clicks from multiple species.


## Configuring the matched click classifier

The matched click classifier settings are accessed via **Settings-> Matched click classifier**_. The settings are split into the three sections, general settings, click waveform and click templates.

### General Settings

The general settings allow for channel options, species ID and the default colours for classified clicks to be to be set. 
_
Channel Options _allows users to define whether a single click from one channel, all clicks or an averaged click should be used to be used for classification in multi-channel situations. if there is only one channel then this makes no difference. 

_Click Type_ sets the number that defines the species ID. Make sure this is not the same as any of the species IDs in the default click classifier (this is why the default is set so high). 

_Symbol_ and _Fill_ define the default colours clicks which have been classified by the matched click classifier should be plotted on displays. 

###  Click Waveform Settings

Before a click is classified it undergoes some pre-conditioning by the matched click classifier. 

_Restrict parameter extraction to XX samples_ sets the maximum length of the waveform to the classifier. If this is selected, then center of the click is located and samples trimmed around the center. In some use cases, for example SoundTrap detections, which may be 10,000 samples long, setting a lower number of maximum samples can greatly increase processing speed and improve the accuracy of results. Note that if the number of samples is set too low (e.g. well below the click template length) then the correaltion values will not make much sense.

_Peak threshold_ and _Smoothing_ are both parameters used to find the click center so that a click can be trimmed to the maximum number of samples. The click length is measured by calculating the waveform envelope using a Hilbert Transform. The envelope is smoothed using a moving average filter (the _Smoothing_ parameter defines the size of the averaging window). The click is trimmed as follows. First the peak of the waveform envelope is found. The length of the click is defined as the point at which the click falls _Peak threshold_ dB below the peak. The center of the click is then the middle of this snippet. The click is then trimmed from the center of the click. 

_Amplitude normalisation_ If there is a very loud click compared to a template it's correlation score will be different to that of a very quiet click of with exactly the same waveform. It is therefore a good idea to normalise the waveform before it is compared the match click classifier. The types of normalisation are 
* _norm_ - this is the default - the click is divided by it's RMS amplitude. A waveform correalted with itself will return 1 as the maximum correlation value. 
* _peak to peak_ this can be useful for some types of shorter click e.g. dolphins - the click is divided by it's peak to peak amplitude.
* _none_ no normalisation (not recommended). A waveform correlated with itself will return a value dependent on the amplitude and frequency content of the waveform. 
 
###  Template settings

The matched click classifier has two templates, a match and a reject. The match template should match a stereotypical click of the target species and the reject template can either be a click from a confounding species (e.g. dolphin) or blank. Selecting the drop-down menu from the _Import_ button allows for a selection of some default templates. Custom templates can be imported by selecting the _Import_ button. Custom templates can either be a .csv. or .mat file using the following format. 

**.csv** - the first _row_ are the waveform measurements from -1 to 1 (make sure you save with a sufficient number of decimal points). The second row and first column is the sample rate in sample per second.

**.mat** - a .mat file that contains two variables named _sR_ and _waveform_. _sR_ is the sample rate in samples per second and _waveform_ is a 1D array containing the waveform for the template form -1 to 1. Arrays of click structures imported using the PAMGuard to MATLAB library can also be used. The first channel of the first click in a list of clicks structures will be imported as the template. The click structure should be names _clicks_ and the sample rate should be saved as a seperate variable named _sR_ in sampes per second.

The match and reject templates are plotted to provide a user with some visualisation of the classifier settings - the drop down menu allows the user to select different ways to plot the templates and is purely for visualisation purposes so makes no difference to classifier settings. 

_threshold_ is the threshold at which a click is classified. If the difference between the match and reject templates is above the _threshold_ value then the 
click is classified. 

The + button can be used to add more tabs. Each tab contains a click/reject template pair and unique threshold setting. A click is classified if at least one of the match/reject templates passes it's set threshold. 

## Visualising Results

The matched click classifier changes the species type flag of a click if at least one of the classifiers passes threshold. This means clicks can be visualised in the click bearing time display or the time base display. The classifier also saves the correlation values for each match/reject template pair which can be accessed in MATLAB/R or through the PAMGuard GUI. 

### Click bearing time display

Matched clicks can be viewed in the bearing time display. If a click passes the threshold of one match/reject pair then the click symbol (defined in general settings) is shown in the bearing time display if _Colour by Matched Template Classifier_ is selected in the right click menu. The correlation values are shown by hovering the mouse over a click to bring up the info tool tip.

### Time base display

The time base display FX can show clicks classified by the matched clicks classifier. _Colour by Matched Template Classifier_ must be selecting in the right settings window.

Note that the time base display allows users to export clicks to be used as templates. Using the advanced pop up menu right click on a click detection and select the MATLAB icon. A .mat file of the selected click or clicks will be saved to your root user folder in a folder called _PAMGuard Manual Export_.  This .mat file can be opened by the matched click classifier - the first channel of the first click in the list will be imported as a template.

### Extracting correlation values using MATLAB/R 

Clicks are loaded from binary files using the MATLAB/R function 

```
clicks  = loadPamguardBinaryFile("/path/to/pamguardfile.pgdf");
```

where clicks is a list of MATLAB/R structures containing the data for each click in the file. 

The matched click classifier template threshold, match value and reject value are then accessed from each click using

```
matchedtemplatevals = clicks(1).annotations. mclassification
```

```matachedtemplatevals``` is a list of where each row is the threshold value, match value and reject value for each match/reject template pair.
