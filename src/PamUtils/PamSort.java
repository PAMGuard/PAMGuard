	 * Function for sorting when a single data unit has been added to

	 * This requires a maximum of a single pass through the data and can exit as 
	 * soon as the correct position is found. this has only been implemented for 
	 * Lists that implement RandomAccess, for other (Linked) lists, this would be
	 * very slow, so for those lists, it's reverting to a full sort. <br> 
	 * Primarily, this was written to more efficiently add new data units to super detections.
	 * @param anyList list with a single new data at it's end that must be sorted into position. Elements 
	 * must implement the Comparable interface.
