# Blue whale Koogu models.

There are two versions of blue whale models BmD_24_tf_model and BmD_23_tf_model in standard Tensorflow saved_.pb format. 

There is also a blue_whale_24.kgu model which is the standard PAMGaurd compatible format for koogu models. This contains settings to set up the model automtically.
