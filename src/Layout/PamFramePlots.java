 *Abstract class PamFramePlots is used to layout graphics windows which have
 *a border (generally grey) and some kind of inner display panel. Normally the outer 
 *panel will contain the axis and the inner panel any other graphics, such as a spectrogram.
 *<p> For an example see SpectrogramDisplay which is a subclass of PamFramePlots
 *SpectrogramDisplay sets axisPanel to a SpectrogramAxis, which is in turn subclassed from PamAxisPanel.
 *it also sets plotPanel to SpectrogramPlotPanel, which is a subclass of JPanel and it sets 
 *eastPanel to AmplitudePanel which is used for drawing a colour bar representing amplitude.
