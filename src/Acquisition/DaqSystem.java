/**

 * Abstraction to multiple data acquisition devices. This interface performs
 * the following tasks:
 * <p>
 * 1. Provides information about the device such as min and max sample rates, number of channelse, etc.
 * 2. Provides a dialog panel with specific options. This automatically gets incorporated into a more
 * general data acquisition panel
 * 3. Provides threads and any other functions necessary to create packets of raw audio data in
 * PamDataUnit's.
 * 4. Each concrete class should, if needed, save it's own setting using the PamSettings package.
 * <p>
 * Current examples are in SoundCardSystem and FileInputSystem
