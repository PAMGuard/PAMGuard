User Display Panel
------------------

### Overview

User display panels are containers for other types of display window.

Each User Display panel will appear as a new tab on the PAMGuard GUI and can contain multiple display windows.

Currently supported standard display windows that can be incorporated into a display panel are:  
[Spectrogram displays](../../spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html)  
['Radar' displays](../../radarDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Radar.html)  
[Maps](../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html)  
[Time based displays](../../timedisplayfx/docs/timedisplayfx.html)

Several other PAMGuard modules may also create display windows which can be shown in a user display panel. The display menu will automatically show these additional displays when they are available.

### Creating an instance of the user display

From the _File>Add module_ menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select "_User Display Panel_". Enter a name for the new display panel (e.g. spectrograms, Ishmael data, etc) and press _Ok_.

### Adding display windows to the user display

To add display windows to the user display, from the User Display menu select either _New Spectrogram�_, _New Radar Display�_ etc.

### Window Layout

Individual display windows may be dragged and resized in the normal way. Alternatively, you may use the options in the User _Display>Arrange Windows_ sub menu.

The positions of windows will be remembered when you exit PAMGuard.

### Scroller Coupling

Many display components, such as [spectrograms](../../spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html), [the map](../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html) and [time based displays](../../timedisplayfx/docs/timedisplayfx.html) contain a scroller which can be used to move back and forth through data, particularly when using [PAMGuard Viewer mode](../../../overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html) to review previously analysed data.

Rules for scroller coupling are set from the _User Display / Scroller Coupling_ menu:

![Scroller coupling dialog](./images/scrollcoupling.png)

No Coupling: Scrollers will not be coupled and can be moved independently.  
Couple scroller starts: Start times of scrollers will follow each other.  
Couple scroller middles: Middle / centre times of scrollers will follow each other.  
Couple scroller range: Scrollers will maintain overlap, but more more independently.
