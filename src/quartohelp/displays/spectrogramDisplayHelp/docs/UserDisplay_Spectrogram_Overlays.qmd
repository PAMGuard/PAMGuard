Spectrogram Display
===================

Graphic Overlays
----------------

  
The pop-up menu on each spectrogram panel gives access to a list of detector data that can be overlain on top of the spectrogram.

The list of graphic overlays will depend on which detectors are available in the current PAMGuard configuration. The overlays can be set individually for each panel.
