Measurements and Classification
-------------------------------

  

### Classification technique

ROCCA classifies whistles, clicks and encounters using Random Forest classifiers. ROCCA currently uses a Random Forest classifier model based on the open-source statistical software package [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html). For more information on Random Forests and the WEKA package, the user is encouraged to refer to the book [Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/book.html)

To classify a whistle, the vector of variables measured from that whistle is analysed with the random forest model, which contains hundreds of classification trees. Each tree in the forest classifies the whistle and final classification is based on the species that the greatest percentage of trees voted for. If the greatest percentage of tree votes falls below the whistle threshold (as specified in the [ROCCA Parameters window](rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsClassifier)) , the whistle is classified as Ambiguous.

To classify a click, the vector of variables measured from that click is analysed with the random forest model, which contains hundreds of classification trees. Each tree in the forest classifies the click and final classification is based on the species that the greatest percentage of trees voted for. If the greatest percentage of tree votes falls below the click threshold (as specified in the [ROCCA Parameters window](rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsClassifier)) , the click is classified as Ambiguous.

\*Latitude and Longitude are not measured from the whistle and click data, but taken from the GPS source as specified in the [Rocca Parameters Window Source tab](rocca_Configure.html#rocca_SourceTab).

Each [encounter number](rocca_Sidebar.html) holds a list of possible species based on the whistle/click classifier models used. There are two values stored for each species: the number of times a whistle/click has been classified to that species (displayed), and a cumulative total of all the percentage tree votes for the species (not displayed). When a new whistle/click classification is saved to an encounter number, the count of the classified species is increased by one and the percentage tree votes for each species are added to the corresponding cumulative totals.

The encounter is classified in one of two ways:

1.  If an encounter classifier has been loaded, the vector of encounter parameters and the random forest probabilities from the whistle and click classifiers are analysed with the encounter random forest and the encounter is classified as the species with the highest percentage of tree votes.
    
2.  2\. If no encounter classifier has been selected by the user, the encounter is classified as the species with the highest cumulative percentage of tree votes. Note that this may be different than the species most often classified - the value shown in the sidebar species list. If the highest cumulative percentage of tree votes falls below the school threshold (as specified in the [ROCCA Parameters window](rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsClassifier)), the detection is classified as Ambiguous.
