PAMGuard's Deep Learning Module
===============================

Common bugs and mistakes
------------------------

The first time you use the module and/or load a different type of model e.g. a tensorflow or pytorch model, you must be connected to the internet.

You must install the correct version of CUDA for hardware acceleration using an Nvidea GPU. See the currently supported CUDA versions on the Pytorch and Tensorflow websites.

You should always have deep learning models in their own folder. Do not have any additional jar files or other programming related things (like .dll files) in the same or sub folders. This has been known to cause issues with loading models which we have not got to the bottom of yet.

Pytorch models must be saved using jit to be compatible with PAMGuard.

Tensorflow models must be saved as .pb files to be opened in PAMGuard.
