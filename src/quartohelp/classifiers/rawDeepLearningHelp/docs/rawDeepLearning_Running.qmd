PAMGuard's Deep Learning Module
===============================

Running
-------

### Real time

In real time, the deep learning model runs automatically when processing starts. A warning will appear if there are issues with the model and/or it cannot cope with real time speeds.

### Viewer Mode

The deep learning module can be re-run on _detector_ data (e.g. click or clip detections) in PAMGuard _viewer_ mode. Detections can be reclassified by selecting the _Settings > Raw Deep Learning Classifier > Reclassify detections_. Select the data range in the reprocessing dialog e.g. Loaded Data and select _Start_. Detections without a deep learning annotation will have one added and detections with an existing annotation will have it overwritten.
