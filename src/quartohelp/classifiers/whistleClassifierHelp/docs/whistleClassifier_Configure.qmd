Whistle Classifier
==================

Configuration
-------------

The **_Detection / Whistle Classifier_** menu has two sub menus: **_[Settings...](#settings)_** and **_[Discriminant Function Training](whistleClassifier_Training.html)..._**

### Settings Menu

From the settings menu a dialog will appear, the top half of which will contain a drop down list of data sources and buttons to select the operation mode.

#### Data Source

Select the data source. This should be the connected regions output from a [Whistle and Moan detector](../../whistleMoanHelp/docs/whistleMoan_Overview.html).

#### Operation Mode

Select either Run Classifier, in which case new detections from the [Whistle and Moan detector](../../whistleMoanHelp/docs/whistleMoan_Overview.html) will be fragmented and the fragments sent for classification, or [Collect Training Data](whistleClassifier_CollectTraining.html) in which case the contours of detected whistles will be stored for Discriminant Function Training
