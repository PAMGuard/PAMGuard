### Effort

Effort data are recorded in the Effort panel

Select when you are on and off listening effort. The times you go on and off listening effort will be written to the database

You can also select the numbers of the hydrophones you are monitoring at any moment.

  

### Things Heard

When you hear things, click on the appropriate button for that species or type of noise and a subjective indication of how loud it is

0 - can no longer hear it

...

5 - very loud

You can also enter text comments with any additional information

  

### History

### Database Output

Both the effort data and the things heard data are written to the PAMGuard database.
