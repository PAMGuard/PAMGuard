Overview
--------

Alarms can be used to alert the operator to specific events

Alarms can be triggered by absolutely any type of data within PAMGuard, whether it be detections, such as whistles or clicks, or a rise in noise levels.

To add a new Alarm module to PAMGuard, select the _**File>Add Modules>Utilities>Alarm**_ menu command.

Give the alarm a name, e.g. "Whistle Alarm" and click OK.

Each alarm can only trigger on one type of data. It is however possible to add multiple alarms to a single PAMGuard configuration.
