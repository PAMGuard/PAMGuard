 Hydrophone Depth Readout Overview  

Hydrophone Depth Readout
========================

Overview
--------

The Hydrophone depth readout module can be used to read hydrophone depth information from one or more analogue depth sensors which output a voltage that changes as hydrophone depth changes.

For current loop depth sensors (which output a current proportional to depth), the current output can be passed through a small resistor create a voltage.

The system currently only works with MeasurementComputing data acquisition cards ([www.mccdaq.com](http://www.mccdaq.com)) but may be extended to support other devices in the future.

Time-stamped depth information is passed to the [hydrophone array manager](../../hydrophoneArrayManagerHelp/docs/Array_Overview.html) which makes it available to other PAMGUARD modules as required, the information from the sensors effectively overriding the default depth information in the [hydrophone array configuration dialog](../../hydrophoneArrayManagerHelp/docs/Array_Configuration.html).

A small side panel shows a graph of recent depth history.

### Database output

Both the raw voltage data and the calculated depth for each sensor are written to the [database](../../generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html). It is therefore possible to recalculate depths off-line if depth sensors are re-calibrated at any point. (PAMGUARD will not currently do this for you - you'll have to work it out for yourself using your own software).
