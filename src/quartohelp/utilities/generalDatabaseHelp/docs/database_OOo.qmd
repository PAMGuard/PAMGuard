OpenOffice.org (OOo) databases
------------------------------

**The OO Database is not currently working and should not be used**

To use a Open Document Format databases no external database software or engine is required however if you would like to view the database [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) and [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) are good choices.

PAMGUARD works with OpenOffice databases (.odb).

Like MS Access, using these Open Databases, all your data ends up in a single file which is easy to copy and move and send to other users, however while PAMGUARD is open the files are extracted then rebuilt at the end.

### Configuring an OpenOffice database

PAMGUARD is able to create an OpenOffice database(.odb) at time of selection provided with a location.

You do not need to add tables to the database, PAMGUARD will automatically create the tables it needs.
