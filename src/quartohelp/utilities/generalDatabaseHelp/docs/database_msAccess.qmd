MS Access
---------

 _**Please note that PAMGuard is not currently able to connect to Microsoft Access databases.  
This is caused by the [removal of the JDBC-ODBC bridge in Java 8](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/bridge.html).  
We recommend that you use [SQLite databases](database_sqlite.html)  
Limited connectivity to MS Access for the [import and export](import_export.html) of data is provided using the open source UCanAccess library.

If you are still using Java 7, then the following still apply ...**_

To use a MS Access database you will need a licensed copy of MS Access on your computer or the 32-bit MS Access database engine available [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/4/3/24375141-E08D-4803-AB0E-10F2E3A07AAA/AccessDatabaseEngine.exe) supported on XP sp3, Vista sp1 and Windows 7

PAMGuard works with Microsoft 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010 databases (.mdb and .accdb).

One advantage of using a MS Access databases is that all your data end up in a single file which is easy to copy and move and send to other users.

### Configuring an MS Access database

PAMGuard is able to create an MS access 2007 database(.accdb) at time of selection provided with a location.

You do not need to add tables to the database, PAMGuard will automatically create the tables it needs.
