SQLite Databases
----------------

[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) is a single file database and is an excellent replacement for Microsoft Access. Data are stored in a single file which can easily be backed up and copied between computers.

SQLite is cross platform so should work on Mac's and Linux platforms as well as Windows.

SQLite is open source and free to use. A number of viewers are available to enable you to view data directly within the database file. We have tested and recommend SQLiteStudio which can be downloaded [here](http://sqlitestudio.pl/).

### Configuring an SQLite database

PAMGuard will automatically create the necessary .sqlite3 database file on your computer.

You do not need to add tables to the database, PAMGuard will automatically create the tables it needs.
