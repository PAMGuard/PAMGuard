### Editing and Deleting

Once a mark is created, you can right click with the mouse close it it's center and a pop-up menu will appear enabling you to edit or delete the mark (this is easier in viewer mode than during real time processing).

You can also drag the edges of the marks with the mouse to alter the time and frequency limits.
