Species Cluster Selection
-------------------------

### Species Cluster

The Species Clusters panel allows the user to specify which species to test for.

Species are selected by checking the box next to their name, under the type of test desired. For descriptions of the Quick Test and Random Drill Test, please see [the Overview](SIDE_Overview.html#tests) page. The selected clusters should match the species for which you intend to monitor.

The **_Nominal Range_** value is the minimum detection range for the species. This is used as the mean distance from the receiver for generated signals, and would typically equal your exclusion zone for that cluster. Signals will be injected both inside and outside the Nominal Range using the **_Test Range Limits_** (see below) as a modifier.

  

### Test Range Limits

The Test Range Limits window allows the user to specify the dispersion of the generated sounds.

Species sounds are randomly distributed between the minimum distance (_Nominal Range_/_Range Factor_) and the maximum distance (_Nominal Range_ × _Range Factor_). To minimize sequences injected at very close and very far ranges, edit the factor to 2. To increase the sequences that are injected at very close and very far ranges, increase the factor above 4
