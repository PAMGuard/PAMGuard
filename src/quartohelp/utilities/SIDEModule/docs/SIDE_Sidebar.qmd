Sidebar
-------

The Sidebar shows the current operational state, as well as information about the last test run.

The current operations status can be selected from the drop-down text box. In order to properly log a status change to the database, a selection must be made from the text box _even if the correct status is already displayed_. When a status is selected, it will be shown in the [Operations State](SIDE_InfoTables.html#opState) table in the middle of the SIDE Module display, along with a time stamp to indicate when the status was changed.

The test information can be displayed or hidden by clicking on the arrow (![](images/SIDEArrow.PNG)). Use this feature if you are limited on screen space and don't need to see all of the information.
