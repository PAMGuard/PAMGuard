Reporting Matrix
----------------

The Reporting Matrix links species clusters with detectors, allowing the user to select which detectors they intend to use so that the SIDE module can log and assess the detector performance. If the sensitive bandwidth of a detector does not overlap with the bandwidth of a sound, then the selection box will be disabled. For each cluster the operator can select a primary detector, which will appear first in any reports.

It is the responsibility of the operator to determine which detectors (besides the primary) should be selected. Some may not be suitable for particular sound types, or not used by the operator. For example, if the operator typically annotates a spectrogram or hits print screen to record a detection but rarely clicks the _things I heard_ button, then only the first two options would be selected. There is no detriment to activating all actions; however, it will require additional analysis on the operators part to assess detection performance by combining all the actions, and selecting irrelevant detectors will generate a very cluttered report.

The SIDE module will only report the detection performance based on a single user action.
