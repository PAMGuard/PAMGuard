READONGPS Property
==================

The READONGPS Property is used to make a form automatically save it's data every time new GPS data are collected.

Forms using READONGPS should therefore only contain controls which can be updated automatically, such as times and NMEA data.

READONGPS is typically used for collecting other NMEA data, such as weather information, each time GPS data are read.

### Required Fields
