READONNMEA Property
===================

The READONNMEA Property is used to make a form automatically save every time a specified NMEA string arrives.

Typically, READONMEA is used if you want to store every instance of a particular string. In this case, you will need to build a form containing a number of fields of types NMEACHAR, NMEAFLOAT and NMEAINT which will read individual values from the NMEA string and store them in database columns.

Note that this is very different to reading on a timer which will only ever store the latest data from a particular string.

### Required Fields

**Autoupdate**

The time interval in seconds at which the form should be automatically saved
