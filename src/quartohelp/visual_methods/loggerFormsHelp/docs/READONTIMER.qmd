READONTIMER Property
====================

The READONTIMER Property is used to make a form automatically save it's data at regular fixed intervals.

Forms using READONTIMER should therefore only contain controls which can be updated automatically, such as times and NMEA data.

READONTIMER is typically used for collecting analogue data (not yet implemented) or NMEA data such as weather information at fixed intervals.

### Required Fields

**Autoupdate**

The time interval in seconds at which the form should be automatically saved
