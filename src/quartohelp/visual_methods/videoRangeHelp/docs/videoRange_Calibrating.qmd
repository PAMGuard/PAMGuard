Calibration
-----------

A calibration factor is required to allow distances measured on the image (in pixels) to be converted into angles subtended at the lens and a new a factor will be needed for each camera / zoom combination.

Calculation of a calibration factor using PAMGuard involves making measurements between points on a perpendicular image of an object of known size taken at a known range, with the camera and zoom setting to be used for later range measurements.

To open the image press either the **Paste** or **File** buttons under **Image** in the control panel as appropriate (depending on whether the image has bee stored as a file or on the clipboard.)

Use the cursor to mark two known points on the object.

A dialogue opens prompting for the distance between these points (in cm) and the range from the camera to the object (in m). Provide a sensible name for the calibration factor (e.g. "Full Zoom") and store it.

_In the image above the distance between two white bands 50cm apart on a pole placed 46m from the camera have been marked. The calibrations factor will be stored with the name "Full Zoom"._

This calibration factor will now be available to be chosen for future analysis of any images taken with these camera settings.
