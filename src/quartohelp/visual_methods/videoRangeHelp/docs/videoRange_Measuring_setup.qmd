Range Measurement Setup
-----------------------

To measure a range from an image choose a previously entered Height in the **Height** drop down dialogue.

If an appropriate height has not be set then press _**Settings>Heights> Add**_

Enter the camera height above sea level and give it a sensible name

The **Settings** tabs allow different choices of calculation method to be chosen

The "Round Earth" method is most straight forward and quite adequate for closer objects.

The "Refraction Method" makes allowances for predicted refraction conditions based on the prevailing temperature, temperature gradient and atmospheric pressure. Values for these must be added in the appropriate fields.

The final choice, under **Analysis**, is between Measuring from the Horizon and Measuring from the Shore.

Measuring from the shore line is an advanced option to be used when a shore line and no horizon is visible behind the object of interest. Details of how to use this option are found here. [Measuring to the Shore](videoRange_MeasureToShoreline.html)
