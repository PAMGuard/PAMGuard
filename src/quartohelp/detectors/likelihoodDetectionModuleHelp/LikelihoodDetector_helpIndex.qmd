Welcome to a new Help Project
-----------------------------

### General Remark

This is a default welcome page that is displayed when you open your helpset in the viewer without specifying a target. Change it according to your needs. If you do not like this template, you can also edit the file `%INSTALLDIR%/templates/index.html`.

Now you can create your HTML content files. Put them in subdirectories of your project directory.
