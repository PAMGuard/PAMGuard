Notes
-----

To help keep track of GPL configurations, enter notes to describe your configuration.

The notes tab has two boxes you can type into and you. The top box will automatically be filled with information about files you [import configurations](defaults.html) from, which will always overwrite exiting text. Therefore your 'main' notes should be added to the lower of the two boxes.
