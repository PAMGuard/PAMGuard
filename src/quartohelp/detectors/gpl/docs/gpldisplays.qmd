### Whitened spectrogram data

The whitened spectrogram is only calculated for the frequency range specified in the settings, with data at other frequencies set to 0. It can be viewed either using the [Spectrogram Display](../../../displays/spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html) or the [Time Display FX](../../../displays/timedisplayfx/docs/timedisplayfx.html). In either case simple select the GPL Whitened Spectrogram as the data source. Note however, that during the whitening process the scale of the data changes, so the displayed amplitude values no longer have any meaning.

#### GPL detection overlays

Detected contours can be displayed as overlays on the [Spectrogram Display](../../../displays/spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html). Simply right click on the display and select GPL Detector Detections. To change colour options, click on the small options button to the left of the menu item.

Similarly, GPL detections can be shown as overlays on the [PAMGuard map](../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/mapDisplay.html). If GPL detections have been [localised](localisation.html) bearing lines and / or 2D or 3D localisations will be displayed.

#### Detection Statistic / Trigger Function

Viewing the summed power in the detection frequency band is a useful way of checking on detector performance. The statistic for each channel the detector is running on can be shown as a line graph in the [Spectrogram Display](../../../displays/spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html) or the [Time Display FX](../../../displays/timedisplayfx/docs/timedisplayfx.html).. To view the data, once you�ve created the GPL Detector and the Time Display, simply add �GPL Level� to a display graph as shown in the examples above.
