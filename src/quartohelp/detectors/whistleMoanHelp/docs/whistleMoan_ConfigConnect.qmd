Connected Region Search
-----------------------

  
Once the [threshold](WhistleMoan_ConfigNoise.html#thresholding) has been applied to the spectrogram data in the [noise removal](whistleMoan_ConfigNoise.html#) stage, the Whistle and Moan detector searches for connected regions in the spectrogram matrix.

### Min Frequency and Max Frequency

Usually, you will want the Whistle and Moan detector to search the whole range of available frequencies, from 0 Hz to half the sample rate. However, these parameters give you the opportunity to limit the connected region search to a specific frequency band. This can be particularly useful if your data are contaminated by a lot of noise at a particular frequency.

### Connection Type

When searching for connected regions, two main connection types are available.

Connect 4 tries to connect each pixel to other pixels directly above, below, to the left or to the right (i.e. 4 possible connections).

Connect 8 tries to connect to the sides and on the diagonals (i.e. 8 possible connections).

Clearly connect 8 will detect more whistles and can also detect whistles sweeping more rapidly, however connect 8 may also be prone to a higher rate of false alarm if it connects things which shouldn't be connected.

### Minimum length and Minimum total size

There will always be a small number of random spectrogram pixels which are above threshold but are not part of a whistle or tone. Generally (hopefully !) these will few in number and the chances of them connecting to other random pixels to make a large connected region will be small.

All connected regions which are shorter than the minimum length, or have fewer pixels than the minimum total size will be discarded.
