The side panel displays a running tally of the number of clicks and click events that have occurred. Also displayed is the name of the alarm that is currently sounding (or _No Alarm Sounding_, as shown above, if there is no alarm at the moment).

Pressing the Test Alarm button will sound each of the currently defined alarms, one at a time, with a short pause in between.
