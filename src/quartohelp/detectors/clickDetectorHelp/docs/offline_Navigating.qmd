Click Detector Viewer Function
==============================

Navigating through Data
-----------------------

The Pamguard viewer mode allows navigation through large data sets. The [data map](../../../utilities/datamap/docs/datamap.html) can be used to look at large volumes of data over long periods of time. Possible areas of interest can be found by using the datagram and click counter in the appropiate data density graphs (i.e. click detector-clicks). You can switch between the views by right clicking on the display.

If an area of interest is found right click on the data map and select _'center data here'_ or _'start data here'_. This will load the clicks at this time into the bearing time display. Here individual clicks can be selected, viewed and [added to an event](offline_MarkingOutEvents.html).  
  
See [Viewer Overview](../../../overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html) for more details on bearing time display navigation.
