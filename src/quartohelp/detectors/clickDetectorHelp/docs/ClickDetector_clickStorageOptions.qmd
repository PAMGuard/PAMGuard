### Database Storage

Individual clicks may be written to the PAMGuard database.

Be warned though that writing to the database can be slow and can seriously affect overall PAMGuard performance

### RainbowClick files

The click detector also stores click data in a format compatible with the IFAW RainbowClick software. This allows RainbowClick can be used for offline data analysis. Offline analysis is currently not as well developed in PAMGuard as it is in Rainbowclick.

For the files to be compatible with RainbowClick, the click detector must be [configured](ClickDetector_clickDetector.html) to analyse pairs of channels. If you have multiple pairs of hydrophones you should use RainbowClick version 4.06.0000 or higher.

To enable RainbowClick compatible file storage check the _'Create RainbowClick File(s)'_ check box.

Use the browse button and edit box to set the output directory for your data.

Use the File Initials text field to set a number of characters to be used at the start of the file name. The remainder of the name is constructed automatically with the date and time at the start of the file.

To avoid single files becoming too large, use the _'File Length'_ edit box to set a maximum length for each file.
