Tracking and Click Train Identification
---------------------------------------

  

### Click Train Identification

![ClickTrainId (7K)](images/ClickTrainId.png)  
  

To automatically detect click trains, check the Run Click Train Id.

Click trains are sequences of clicks on a consistent bearing with a consistent inter click interval. This system is currently optimised for sperm whale click train identification.

If a click train reaches sufficient length and the bearing change is adequate, target motion analysis is used to automatically calculate a range and bearing to the sound source.

Bearings and ranges to click trains can be overlaid on the [PAMGuard map](../../../mapping/mapHelp/docs/overview.html).
