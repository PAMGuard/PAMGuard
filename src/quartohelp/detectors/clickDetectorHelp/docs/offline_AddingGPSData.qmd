You have to add or imprt the gpsData table into your database for the offline analysis. If you followed the steps described in [creating binaries offline](../../../utilities/BinaryStore/docs/CreateBinariesOffline.html), you still need to add the GPS processing module **_File>Add module...>Maps and Mapping>GPS processing_** first time you open up Pamguard Viewer. Also if you want to have a map you also need to add the module **_File>Add module...>Maps and Mapping>Map_**. You need to close Pamguard Viewer after you added these modules, and open it up again so it can load the GPS data.
