Click Detector Map Options
--------------------------

  

### Click Detector Map Options

Click detector map options are accessed from the _**Click Display>Map Options�**_ menu.

These apply only to automatically detected click trains.

Click trains may contain varying levels of information. Short click trains will only have a bearing to the detected source. Longer trains that alter bearing by more than a few degrees will also have a calculated range.

Sequences of sperm whale clicks from a single source are generally broken up into shorter trains by the click train detection algorithm.

Click trains with range information are always shown. The shorter and more numerous click trains that do not have range information can rapidly clutter the map.

By selecting the radio buttons the operator can choose to plot either:

*   none of the short click trains,
    
*   all of the short click trains,
    
*   or only those which are separated from other plotted click trains by a minimum time interval or change in bearing.
    

If no range information is present, the bearing lines on the map are drawn at a fixed length.
