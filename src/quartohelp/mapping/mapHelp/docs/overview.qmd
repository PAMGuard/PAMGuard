Overview

### Map purpose

The primary purpose of the map is to provide detection and localisation information graphically.  
  
**The PAMGuard map should not, on any account, be used as a tool for navigation.**

  

### Map tab panel

The map is viewed by clicking on the Map tab panel.

This tab display consists of the map itself (left), a map control panel (upper right) and an information display (lower right). The main map graphics are: labeled lines of latitude and longitude, an icon for the vessel hosting the PAMGuard GPS and depth/coast contours.  
  
Detection event graphics can be overlaid on the map by right clicking and selecting the desired overlay type. Further map options can be set from the Map menu item.

### Map Comments

Annotations can be added to the map by double clicking anywhere with the mouse.

A dialog will then appear with the time and position (latitude and longitude) of where the mouse was clicked already filled in.

The operator can then type in a comment which will be stored in the database and a symbol will be displayed on the map, the comment being shown whenever the mouse is hovered over the symbol.
