Airgun Display
==============

Overview
--------

  

During mitigation exercises, it is often required to know the locations of detections relative to an airgun array.

PAMGuard can display the locations of airguns, and the extent of a specified mitigation zone around the guns.

Airgun locations can be set relative to the [GPS receiver](../../NMEA/docs/ConfiguringGPS.html") of the vessel running PAMGuard or relative to the [AIS data](../../AIS/docs/AISOverview.html) received from one or more different vessels.
