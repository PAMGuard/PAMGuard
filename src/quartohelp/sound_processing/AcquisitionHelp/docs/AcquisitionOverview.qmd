 Sound Acquisition  

Sound Acquisition Overview
==========================

PAMGUARD is designed to analyse data in real time using a sound card or other data acquisition device or from previously recorded data stored as a hard disk recording.

### Adding a Sound Acquisition Module

Add a Sound Acquisition module using _**File>Add Modules>Sound Processing>Sound Acquisition**_ and enter a name of your choice.

### Using Multiple Sound Acquisition Modules

It is possible to have multiple sound acquisition modules, which is particularly useful if you want to run detectors at different sample rates.
