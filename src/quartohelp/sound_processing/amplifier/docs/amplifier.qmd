Signal Amplifier
================

The Signal Amplifier module can be used to increase or reduce the level of an audio signal and can also be used to invert signals.

### Creating a Signal Amplifier

From the **_File>Add modules>Sound Processing_** menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display select "**_Signal Amplifier_**". Enter a name for the new amplifier module and press Ok.

  

### Configuring the Signal Amplifier

To access the module's settings, select _**Detection>Signal Amplifier...**_ from the detection menu. This will bring up a dialogue similar to the one shown below.

Select the sound source from the drop down list

Set the gain for each channel in dB

Check the box if you wish to invert the signal on a channel (multiply all valued by -1).

### Using the Signal Amplifier

Other PAMGuard modules that use raw audio data can then subscribe to the output of the Signal Amplifier module instead of the [sound acquisition module](../../AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html).
