Displaying Clips
----------------

Clips can be displayed on a [User Display Panel](../../../displays/userDisplayHelp/docs/userDisplayPanel.html).

Once you've created your Clip Generator module, an additional menu item will appear in the User Display Panel menu which you can use to create a display.

The advantage of incorporating the display into the more general user display panel is that is can be shown directly alongside spectrogram and radar displays.

Each clip is shown as a small spectrogram. A number of controls at the top of the display allow you to change the time, frequency and amplitude scales of the spectrograms and also control how many are held in memory at any one time.

To create more space on the screen it's possible to hide the control panel by clicking on it's left border.
