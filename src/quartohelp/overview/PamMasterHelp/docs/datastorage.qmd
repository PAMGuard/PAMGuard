Data Storage
============

PAMGuard has two data storage options:

1.  [The Database](../../../utilities/generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html)
2.  [The Binary Store](../../../utilities/BinaryStore.docs/binarystore_overview.html)

Each has advantages and disadvantaged.

The great advantage of the database is that stored data are generally in a form which is each to read either as a human, or via some other software.

However, the database interface can be slow and the database is very inefficient at handling variable length records, such as the waveform of a click, or the contour of a whistle.

The Binary store is fast and is great at handling any type of data, but the files are impossible to read except with proprietary computer software
