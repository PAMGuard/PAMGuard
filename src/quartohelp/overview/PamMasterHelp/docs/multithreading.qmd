 Multi-threading  

PAMGUARD
========

Multi-threading
---------------

  
PAMGUARD can operate in either a single thread mode, or a multi-thread mode.

In multi-thread mode, each process within each PAMGUARD module operates in a different processing thread, which basically allows several processes to take place at once in a multiprocessor computer.

In single thread mode, actions take place one at a time as data propagates through PAMGUARD.

The advantage of multi-thread operation is that the different tasks will spread between multiple processing cores on the computer, thereby gaining access to more processing power.

In single thread operation, only a single processing core will be used, so less processing power is available.

Multi-threading may introduce instability in some modules, where certain processes have to happen in a certain sequence, so although multi-threading is usually preferable, single thread operation is maintained as an option.

### Turning multi-threading on and off

Multi-threading can be turned on and off from the _**Detection>Multi-threading**_ menu command.

You can also set the amount of "jitter" between threads. This is the maximum amount of data that can be queued between two threads. If the data queue exceeds this time, then the earlier thread will wait until the second thread has processed some of the data in the queue.

More jitter allows more flexibility between threads which can allow PAMGUARD to use multiple processor cores more efficiently. However, increased jitter can cause a loss of synchronisation between the processing, graphics output and sound play back
