Importing Modules
-----------------

  

Settings for individual modules or groups of modules can be imported into a PAMGuard configuration from other configurations on your system. To import modules from another configuration select **_File>Import Modules..._**

A file open dialog will open where you can select the PAMGuard configuration file (.psf file) you wish to import from.

Once you've selected a psf file, a dialog will appear showing a list of modules in that file and giving you options for importing those modules and their configurations into your current configuration.

For each module right click on the right hand (Import Options) column for a drop down list of options. These will be to not import the module, to overwrite the settings for an existing module or to create a new module.

Make your selections and press Ok. Settings will be imported and modules created.
