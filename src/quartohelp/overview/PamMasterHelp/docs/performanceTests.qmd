Performance Tests
-----------------

  

PAMGuard puts a heavy load on the machine it's running on

Machine performance is dependent not just on the CPU speed but also on things like the quality of the graphics card and the types of hard drive

The PAMGuard team are developing a set of performance tests which can be run from within PAMGuard to assess the likely performance of different platforms

### Running the performance tests

Open the performance tests dialog from the **_Help>System performance Tests_** menu

Press the 'Start tests' button

### Interpreting the output of the performance tests

These tests are currently under development and more information will be provided within the performance tests dialog in the near future

As a general guide:

Test 3 the Double precision number crunching, should execute in less than 700 ms.

Test 4 directly drawing dots on the screen should take around 400 - 500 ms

Test 5 drawing dots using a buffered image should take < 100 ms

Test 6 drawing dots using a callback function should take less than 700 ms

These numbers are very preliminary and are based on tests carried out on a Dell Latitude D830 laptop with an Intel Core Duo CPU T9300 @2.5GHz with 3.5 GB of RAM. This machine runs PAMGuard very well.
