 Target Motion Annotation  

Target Motion Annotation
========================

Overview
--------

The Target Motion annotation can be used with the [Detection Group Localiser](../../../localisation/detectiongroup/docs/dglocaliser.html) to automatically localise detections which have been grouped by the user by estimating the most likely crossing point of bearing lines from those individual detections.

The Target Motion Annotation system uses the same algorithms as the real time Target Motion Analysis system in the click detector.

Usage
-----

### Configuring

Any module using Target Motion annotations will offer a way of configuring the Target Motion analyser. (see [Detection Group Localiser](../../../localisation/detectiongroup/docs/dglocaliser.html) for an example). When you enter the configuration for the Target Motion analyser you will be presented with a dialog allowing to select the Target Motion Algorithm and other options.

When data are added to an "event" or "group" the selected Target Motion Analysis algorithms will run on the data to compute the most likely crossing point of all the bearing lines. This location or locations will be saved to the database and will also be displayed on the PAMGuard map.

Stored Data
-----------

Several columns are added to database tables to provide the results of the Target Motion analysis and an estimate on the errors on resulting locations.

If there is a left-right ambiguity in the bearings from the data input to the Target Motion analysis, then two sets of possible localisations will be generated ans stored.
