Text Annotations
================

Overview
--------

Text annotations store a single line of text entered by the user. The length of text that can be entered is currently set by the programmer.

Usage
-----

When required a small dialog box will appear on the screen. The user should enter text and press Ok, or press Cancel if they do not wish to add any text.

A single data field using a name given to the annotation by the programmer (generally 'text' or 'notes') will be added to database tables.
