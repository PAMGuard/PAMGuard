 Geo referencing 3D localisations  

Large Aperture 3D Localiser
===========================

Geo referencing 3D localisations
--------------------------------

### Summary

_Use the MEAL localiser with vector GPS data._

In the last exercise we used a vertical array which we assumed was stationary and determined a porpoise dive profile. In real life it is possible we will be using an array which is not stationary. If this is case there are two vital pieces of information needed to relate localisation information to real world co-ordinates, the heading and latitude/longitude of the array.

Open PAMGUARD viewer mode and select the database **_VertQuad_** in the **_Exercise 4_** folder. Open the binary file folder **_20120715._**

In order to use GPS data you need to add the GPS module. **_Go to File > Add Modules > Maps and Mapping_** and add **_NMEA Data Collection_**, **_GPS Processing_** and **_Map_**. You should see the Map tab appear in PAMGUARD.

To add GPS data go **to Detection > GPS > Import GPS Data....**

In the dialog box open the NMEA file in the Exercise 4 folder. A dialog box will appear asking you to select a date. Ignore this, tick **_Use only GPRMC strings_** and click **_OK_** .

Wait until the GPS data has loaded

Select the map. You should see GPS tracks. Use the slider to move the position of the vessel. You may need to use the scroll bars to load more hours of data into memory.

Figure 27. After successfully importing GPS data you should be able to view the ships’ tracks and heading in the MAP.

Now select the MEAL localiser module and find a suitable porpoise detection. Localise using one of the algorithms. You will notice a realistic GPS position in the _results_ panel

Figure 28. The MEAL localiser will automatically import GPS data and convert localisation results to a real lat/long.
