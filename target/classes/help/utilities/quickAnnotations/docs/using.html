<h2>Using Spectrogram Annotations</h2>

<h3>Creating</h3>

<p>Once configured, simply select the Label from the side panel and drag the mouse across the relevant spectrogram display panel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the &#39;<em>Popup annotation dialog</em>&#39; is enabled, a small dialog will appear where you can enter a short note describing the sound. The Quick Annotation module will&nbsp;also measure signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and a variety of sound-pressure levels (SPL).</p>

<p>NB: Accurate measurement&nbsp;of SPL requires a calibrated hydrophone and acquisition board that have been&nbsp;correctly configured&nbsp;in the Array Manager and Sound Acquisition modules.</p>

<h3>Editing and Deleting</h3>

<p>Once a mark is created, you can right click with the mouse close it it&#39;s center and a pop-up menu will appear enabling you to edit or delete the mark (this is easier in viewer mode than during real time processing).</p>

<p>You can also drag the edges of the marks with the mouse to alter the time and frequency limits.</p>
