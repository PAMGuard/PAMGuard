<h1>Database</h1>
<h2>MySQL</h2>

<p>
MySQL can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>. 
Conveniently MySQL make a windows installer which contains both MySQL server and a client 
to access the data outwith PAMGuard and a nice workbench to easily manage everything. 
It is available from <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/installer/">www.mysql.com/downloads/installer/</a> 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One disadvantage of using a MySQL databases is that the database consists of many files
and transferring a database between machines and users is more complicated than for Access and some other 
database types.  </p>

<h3>Configuring a MySQL database</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To connect to a MySQL database you will need to have a user name and password 
for the MySQL server you are connecting to. You will get this from whoever is
administering MySQL on the machine you are working on. 
</p>
<p>Once you have successfully connected to the MySQL server, you can either select an
existing database or you can automatically create a new database by pressing the 
'Create New' button and filling in the name of the new database.</p>
<p>
You do not need to add tables to the database, PAMGUARD will automatically create all of the tables it needs.
