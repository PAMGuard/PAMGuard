<h1>Audio File Folders</h1>
<p>If you've a whole folder (or many folders) full or archived data than you wish to 
re-analyse, then you can set PAMGUARD up to work it's way through the whole lot in one go</p>
<p>Processing speed and dates and times operate in the same way as for 
<a href="AcquisitionFile.html">single audio file analysis</a></p>

<h2>Setting up Audio File Folders</h2>


<p><center><img alt="File Folder Configuration" src="images/AcquisitionFileFolder.png" /></center></p>


<h3>Select and entire folder</h3>
<p>You can select an entire folder by pressing the "Select Folder of Files" button 
and browsing for the folder containing the files you want to analyse.</p>
<h4>Sub folders</h4>
<p>If you want to analyse multiple sub folders of data, then check the 'Include sub folders' box.</p>

<h3>Select multiple files</h3>
<p>If you don't want to select all files in a folder, then navigate into the folder and highlight
just file files you want to analyse.</p>

<h3>Merging files</h3>
<p>Files will be analysed in alphabetical order. It is not uncommon that a single recording session will have 
been broken into many short files. You can have PAMGUARD merge files which are part of continuous
recording together by checking the 'Merge contiguous files' box. If this box is not checked, then PAMGUARD 
will stop at the end of each file and then restart on the next file.</p>
 
<h3>Time and Date</h3>


<p>During analysis, all times displayed on the screen and all times written to the database or binary storage will
be based on the time extracted from the file name and the sample number within the file.</p>
<p>If a valid date cannot be extracted from the file name, then times will be based on the time 
at which analysis starts and the sample number within the files.</p>

<p>Ideally the file times should be in UTC. If they are not, then the time zone of the file data
can be <a href="FileTimeZone.html">set from the button to the right of the displayed file time</a>.</p>
