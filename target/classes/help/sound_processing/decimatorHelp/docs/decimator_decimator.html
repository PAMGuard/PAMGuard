<h1>Decimator</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Decimators can be used to drop the frequency of raw audio data.</p>
<p>For example, you may have a raw audio data stream sampled at 96kHz (you might have sampled at this search for odontocete clicks); you also want to search for baleen whale sounds at
around 100Hz. It would be inefficient to run the baleen whale detector on the 96kHz data. However, by using the Decimator 
to produce a new raw data stream at a few 100Hz and running the baleen whale detector on this, the total amount of processing will be reduced, spectrogram 
displays will also be more clearer.</p>
<p>
A decimator can be inserted anywhere in the PAMGUARD data model where there are raw audio data. 
</p>

<h3>Creating a Decimator</h3>

<p>
From the <strong><em>File>Add modules>Sound Processing</em></strong> menu, or from the pop-up menu on the 
data model display select "<strong><em>Decimator</em></strong>". 
Enter a name for the new decimator module (e.g. "2kHz", etc) and press Ok.</p>
<br>

<h3>Configure the Decimator</h3>
<p>The Decimator module requires a source of raw data before it can operate. 
This may come directly from a Sound Acquisition module (e.g. a sound card or a National Instruments board) 
or from processed data such as the output from a filter, another decimator, etc. 
</p>
<p>
To configure the decimator, go to the <strong><em>Detection>"your decimator name ...">
menu </em></strong></p>

<p>
Select the data source and specify the sample rate of the output data.
</p> 

<h3>Filter Settings</h3>
<p>
For a decimator to work correctly, you <b>must</b> correctly
filter the data before it is downsampled. 
</p>
<p>
Press the filter settings dialog and the filter dialog will appear (see
<a href="../../FiltersHelp/Docs/Filters_filters.html">the IIRF Filter help</a>). 
You need to set up the filter so that most of the energy is filtered out below the Nyquist 
frequency (half the output sample rate). A low pass 4th or 6th order Chebyshev filter with a cut off frequency 
of 0.8 times the Nyquist frequency should be adequate.
