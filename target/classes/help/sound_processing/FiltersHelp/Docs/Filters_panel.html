	<h1>Filter Design</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<br>

	<p>Two main types of filter are available in PAMGuard. IIRF
		(Infinite Impulse Response) Filters are generally preferred since they
		are faster than the alternative FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter
		types. However there may be circumstances when you prefer to use an
		FIR filter, particularly if an unusual filter response is required
		(for instance, one mimicking the hearing response of an animal, or
		with multiple 'notches' to remove noise).</p>
	<p>
		Both types of filter can be configured from within PAMGuard's filter
		design panel. This is used in the stand alone <a
			href="Filters_filters.html">Filters Module</a>, but also appears in
		the configuration for several other modules, including the <a
			href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickDetector.html">
			click detector</a>, the <a
			href="../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">Decimator</a>
		and some noise measurement modules.
	</p>

	<h3>Configuration</h3>

	<br>
	<h4>Filter Type</h4>
	<p>Select the type of filter, which can be one of: "None", 
	"IIR <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter">Butterworth</a>", 
		"IIR <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_filter">Chebyshev</a>", "FIR Filter (Window Method)",
		"Arbitrary FIR Filter".</p>

	<h4>Filter Response</h4>
	<p>For Butterworth, Chebychev and FIR Filters using the Window
		Method, select either a High pass, Band Pass, Band Stop or Low Pass
		response and the filter cut off frequencies in Hz. Note that these
		should be greater than 0 and less than half of the sample rate.</p>
	<p>Also set the filter order - this controls how steeply the filter
		will attenuate close to the cut off frequencies. High order filters
		use more processing power than low order ones and can also have a long
		impulse response which can reduce the time resolution of transient
		signals. Note that for FIR filters, the filter order parameter that
		you enter is actually the log base 2 of the length of the actual
		filter, i.e. a filter order of 6 will generate 64 tap filer, 7 a 128
		tap filter, etc.</p>
	<p>For Chebychev filters, you can also set the amount of ripple in
		the passband and for FIR filters, you can set 'gamma' which alters the
		rate of filter attenuation verses ripple in the stop band.</p>
	<p>For IIR filters, in the lower left part of the dialog, you will
		see a pole-zero diagram. For FIR filters, this is replaced by the
		filter taps, or impulse response of the filter.</p>

	<br>
	<p>If you have selected an FIR Arbitrary filter, the dialog will
		change to show a list of frequencies and gains.</p>
	<br>
	<img alt="Filters Settings" src="Images/FIRArbitrary.png" />
	<br>
	<p>It's currently only possible to update this list by creating and
	editing a text file, which should be a comma separated list of
	frequencies and gains, e.g.
	</p>
	0, -80
	<br> 5000, -80
	<br> 6000, -40
	<br> 7000, 0
	<br> 11000, -5
	<br> 13000, -10
	<br> 15000, 0
	<br> 17000, 0
	<br> 17000, -30
	<br> 18000, -80
	<br> 24000, -80
	<br>
	<p>Use the import button to import the values from your text file</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Bode Plot</h4>
		<p>The filter dialog displays a bode plot (attenuation verses
			frequency) for the chosen filter parameters. You can show this on either a logarithmic
			of linear frequency scale. Double clicking the amplitude axis will change the range
			of the amplitude scale. </p>
