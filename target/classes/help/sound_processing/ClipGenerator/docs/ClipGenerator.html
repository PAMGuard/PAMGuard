<h1>Clip Generator</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The clip generator module can be used to generate short sound clips (typically a second or so long) in response 
to either an automatic detection or to the user selecting an area on the spectrogram display.  
</p>

<h3>Creating a Clip Generator</h3>
<p>From the <strong><em>File>Add modules>Sound
Processing</em></strong> menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model display
select "<strong><em>Clip Generator</em></strong>". Enter a name for the new
amplifier module and press Ok.</p>
<br>

<h3>Configuring the Clip Generator</h3>
<p>To configure the clip generator, you will need to set a source of audio data and 
also to set up triggers which can initiate clip generation. </p>
<p>To set up the clip generator, open the dialog from the "Detectors/Clip Generator" menu</p>

<br>
<h4>Select an audio data source</h4>
<p>Select a source of audio data. This will usually be from a sound acquisition module
but it may also be from a decimator or filter module</p>


<h4>Select an output format</h4>
<p>Select to store the clips either as wav files or in binary storage. The advantage of
wav files is that it will be possible to open your clips with other software. The binary 
storage option stores the clips in a compressed format which uses slightly less disk space
and also loads the clips more efficiently when looking at them with the PAMGuard viewer. </p>
<p>Even if you are using wav file storage, you should include the Binary Storge module in 
your PAMGuard configuration since some book keeping information will still need to be stored
in binary files</p>

<h4>Setup Data Triggers</h4>
<p>Select which detectors can trigger clips. </p> <p>This can be one or more of the detectors
set up in PAMGuard. If using more than one detector though, you might find it easier to 
have separate clip generators for each detector so that files / binary data are stored in 
different folders. </p>
<p>Once you've enabled a trigger, configure it by pressing the adjacent "Settings" button</p>

<br>
<p>Select the channels you want to trigger from</p>
<p>Select the time in seconds before and after the actual trigger you want to record for. </p>
<p>If data are being stored in wav files, also set "file initials" - a few characters which 
will be added to the start of each file name</p>
<h5>Data Budgets</h5>
<p>You can set the clip generator to respond to every single detection or you 
can set a data budget which will limit the amount of recorded data in a given time period. </p>
<p>The latter option may be useful if you only want to store a few example sounds from each 
encounter for species id check, but also runs the risk of discarding important data !</p>

<h4>Manual clipping</h4>
<p>To generate clips manually, right click on a 
<a href="../../../displays/spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html">spectrogram display</a> 
to open it's settings dialog. Go to the "Mark Observers" tab and select the Clip Generator check box. </p>
<p>When the spectrogram display is running, you will now be able to mark out regions with the mouse which 
will be used to fire the clip generator.  </p>
