	<h1>Generalised Power Law Detector</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The Generalised Power Law (GPL) Detector is a real time
		implementation of the detector described in Helble et al, 2012. This
		detector is particularly useful for the detection of highly variable
		tonal sounds, such as those from humpbacks, where correlation or other
		shape based detectors become ineffective.</p>

	<h3>Algorithm</h3>
	<p>For details of the algorithm, see Helble et al 2012. The papers
		abstract is given here to give a quick summary of what happens. In
		many ways, the algorithm is similar to an in band energy detector,
		however by raising the amplitude of the data in a spectrogram to a
		higher power, tonal sounds become amplified by a much greater amount
		than broader band sources of noise such as shipping or wave motion.</p>
		
	<h4>ABSTRACT (from Helble et al, 2012)</h4>
	<p>Conventional detection of humpback vocalizations is often based on frequency summation of band-limited
		spectrograms under the assumption that energy (square of the Fourier amplitude) is the appropriate metric.
		Power-law detectors allow for a higher power of the Fourier amplitude, appropriate when the signal occupies a
		limited but unknown subset of these frequencies. Shipping noise is non-stationary and colored and problematic
		for many marine mammal detection algorithms. Modifications to the standard power-law form are introduced to
		minimize the effects of this noise. These same modifications also allow for a fixed detection threshold,
		applicable to broadly varying ocean acoustic environments. The detection algorithm is general enough to detect
		all types of humpback vocalizations. Tests presented in this paper show this algorithm matches human detection
		performance with an acceptably small probability of false alarms (P<sub>FA</sub> < 6%) for even the noisiest environments.
			The detector outperforms energy detection techniques, providing a probability of detection PD = 95% for
			P<sub>FA</sub> < 5% for three acoustic deployments, compared to P<sub>FA</sub> > 40% for two energy-based techniques. The
			generalized power-law detector also can be used for basic parameter estimation and can be adapted for other
			types of transient sounds.</p>
