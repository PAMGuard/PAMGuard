<h1>ROCCA</h1>
<h2>Spectrogram Popup Window</h2>
<br>
<p>Once a whistle has been selected in the main spectrogram
window, a new window opens containing the portion of the spectrogram
selected by the user. The user must click on the starting point of the
whistle, and then the ending point (note that these can be reselected
later). Once the starting and ending points have been defined, ROCCA
will extract and display the whistle contour (shown in yellow).</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Window Title: displays the current detection tally. ROCCA
keeps track of how many whistles have been selected in the current
PAMGuard session and displays this information in the window title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zoom In/Out/Reset: changes the zoom level of the
spectrogram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase/Decrease Brightness: modifies the brightness of
the spectrogram. Note that this only modifies the spectrogram display.
&nbsp;The underlying contour extraction algorithm is not affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase/Decrease Contrast: modifies the contrast of the
spectrogram. Note that this only modifies the spectrogram display.
&nbsp;The underlying contour extraction algorithm is not affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noise Sensitivity spinner: modifies the noise sensitivity
parameter used for <a href="rocca_ContourExtractionManipulation.html">contour
extraction</a>. &nbsp;This parameter controls the width of
the frequency band that is used when searching for the peak frequency
in the next time slice (see &#8216;Adjusting noise sensitivity&#8217;). The contour
is automatically recalculated when this value is changed, and the
spectrogram display is updated. Note
that any contour points <a href="rocca_ContourExtractionManipulation.html#manual">moved
manually</a> will not be changed when
the noise sensitivity parameter is changed. Note also that the noise
sensitivity parameter does not change the global noise sensitivity
parameter as specified in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsContour">Rocca
Parameters window</a>, only the noise sensitivity used in this
spectrogram popup window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectrogram window: the current spectrogram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Contour Start/Contour End: allows user to reselect
the starting or ending point of the whistle. Upon selection, the
contour will recalculated automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn Contour Off: toggle the contour display on and off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick Points: when clicked, erases existing contour trace
and enters 'Selection' Mode. In selection mode the user can manually
select points along the contour by clicking on the spectrogram itself.
The user can select any number of points, but only one frequency per
time bin is allowed. If multiple frequencies are selected within a time
bin, only the first is kept and the rest are ignored. The user can also
hold the mouse button down and drag the mouse along the contour to
quickly select multiple points. When the Pick Points button is pressed
a second time, Selection Mode ends. ROCCA will fill in any missing time
bins using linear interpolation, and then proceed to calculate the
contour variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="rocca_ResetFilter">Highpass/Lowpass/Reset
filters:</a> limits the <a href="rocca_ContourExtractionManipulation.html">contour
extraction algorithm</a>so that it functions only within a
specific
frequency band. Specify a filter by either typing in the desired
frequency and hitting &lt;enter&gt;, or hitting the
&lt;Set&gt; button and clicking on the desired frequency in the
spectrogram. The frequency filter is drawn as a horizontal red line on
the spectrogram. The contour is automatically recalculated when these
values are modified, and the spectrogram display is updated. Reset the
filters by clicking the &lt;Reset Filters&gt; button. Note that
any contour points <a href="rocca_ContourExtractionManipulation.html#manual">manually
moved</a> will not be changed. Note also that the spectrogram
display is not affected by the filters, only the contour extraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undo Last Move: return the last contour point that was <a href="rocca_ContourExtractionManipulation.html#manual">moved
manually</a> to its previous location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="rocca_RecalcContour">Recalc Contour</a>:
recalculate the contour after <a href="rocca_ContourExtractionManipulation.html">manually
moving</a> one or more contour points to new positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="rocca_ResetContour">Reset Contour</a>:
unlock all contour points that have been manually moved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classify/Reclassify: classify the currently-extracted
contour, or reclassify the contour after changes have been made. The
classification is displayed to the left of the button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save as encounter <em>[...]</em>: save the
whistle clip wav file, contour points, and measured contour variables
to the directory
specified in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsContour">Rocca
Parameters window</a> using the encounter number that was active
when the whistle was captured in the spectrogram. The encounter number
is shown on the button for reference. The spectrogram popup window is
then closed and the focus returns to the main PAMGuard display.
Classification results will be added to the Rocca <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html">Sidebar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save as diff encounter: save the whistle clip wav file,
contour
points, and measured contour variables to the directory specified in
the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsContour">Rocca
Parameters window</a>, but first query the user as to which <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html">encounter number</a> to use.
The spectrogram popup window is then closed and the focus returns to
the main PAMGuard display.&nbsp;Classification results will be
added to the Rocca <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html">Sidebar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save WAV only: save the whistle clip wav file to the
directory
specified in the <a href="rocca_Configure.html#rocca_ParamsContour">Rocca
Parameters window</a> using the current encounter number (shown
in the window title bar). This option is useful if the user wishes to
classify the whistle later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discard and Exit: discard the current whistle, close the
spectrogram popup window and return to the main Pamguard display
without saving anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time/Frequency: displays the current time and frequency
location of the
cursor.</p>
