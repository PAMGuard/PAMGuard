  <br>
  There are several possible causes of this. Either the 
  <a href="#NoGPSOut"> GPS has no output</a>, 
	the <a href="#NoSerialPort">serial port is incorrectly configured</a>,  
	there is a <a href="#EmptyStrings">problem with 
	the antenna</a> or there is a <a href="NMEAConnections.html"> wiring problem</a>
  between the GPS and computer.

<p><b><a name="NoSerialPort">I can't find the correct serial port</a></b><br>
  <br>
  If you have no serial ports or too many serial ports in the <a
		href="configuringNMEADataSource.html">NMEA Configuration Dialog</a>
  and are using a serial to USB converter check that the drivers are
  correctly installer. On Windows machines, look in the control panel for
  unknown USB devices. If you're having trouble identifying the right
  port, then it may be worth restarting PAMGUARD with and without the
  converter plugged in to see which ports appear and disappear from the
  list in the <a href="configuringNMEADataSource.html">NMEA
        Configuration Dialog</a>.

<p><b><a name="CrazyMouse">The GPS makes my mouse/cursor go
      crazy !</a></b><br>
  <br>
  When a Windows PC starts up and a GPS or other NMEA device is
  connected, the Plug and Play system thinks that a serial mouse or
  trackball has been installed. The system then starts to interpret NMEA
  messages as mouse movements. Your cursor seems to jump all over
  the place and it becomes impossible to control your machine.    </p>
<p>
  To solve this problem either temporarily or permanently, do one
  of the following: 
</p>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> Make sure the GPS is either switched off or is not
        plugged in when you start your system. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Start the system with the GPS
        plugged in and switched on - your system will recognise it as a mouse
        or trackball and go a bit crazy. Before it manages to click on anything
        too important unplug or switch off your GPS. This will enable you to
        control your system without the GPS creating random cursor movements.
        Go into the control panel, select the mouse icon, go to the hardware
        tab and you will see your normal mouse or mice listed as well as the
        annoying phantom mouse which is really the GPS. You can disable it in
        this dialog by selecting the phantom mouse, clicking on the properties
        button and disabling it at the bottom of the properties dialog. You
        only have to do this once in the lifetime of your computer. Your system
        will then start normally whether the GPS is plugged in or not as you
        start up (i.e. it will continue to recognise the GPS as a mouse, but
        will know that it's disabled and not use it). If you start your
        computer without the GPS plugged in, then the GPS will not appear in
        the list of mice in the control panel, so you can't disable it in the
        way outlined above. I've done this on dozens of machines and it always
        seems to work and does not interfere in any way with other mice on your
        system - just make sure you disable the right one !</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p name="NoGPSOut"><b><a name="NoGPSOut">The GPS isn't outputting any data</a></b><br>
  <br>
  If you're convinced that the GPS is correctly connected any you still aren't getting any 
	data, then it's possible that the GPS has been configured to either not output data at all,
	to output data in a different format or at a different baud rate.  
</p>
<p>
  This is unlikely with marine GPS's, but many hand held devices are set to different 
	communications protocols. Refer to the manufacturers hand book (or jab about randomly at the 
	GPS's menu options) and set it to output data in NMEA 0183 format at 4800 baud.

  <br>
  If data are getting into the computer and you can see strings in the 
  <a href="configuringNMEADataSource.html#NMEAStringList">NMEA Strings List</a> which are 
	mostly lot's of ,,,,,,,, then 
	the most likely explanation is that you've no satellite signal. Check your antenna has a 
	clear view of the sky. If your GPS has only been switched on for a few minutes and has moved 
	a long distance since it was last switched on it may take some minutes to find satellites. 
	Refer to the manufacturers handbook for further information.
