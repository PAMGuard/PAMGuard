<h1>NMEA</h1>
<h2>NMEA Connections</h2>

<p>Often on larger boats, NMEA signals will be distributed by wire and available at several location. </p>
<p>Connection to a 9 pin serial connector is very simple. In a 9 pin D plug connect:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Pin 2	to NMEA Data in (‘Data Out’ form GPS or other NMEA device) </p>
  <p>
    Pin 5	to Ground (usually the same wire as connects to the negative of the power supply)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is not necessary to make any other connections. PAMGUARD does not send any data back to the GPS, 
so connection of Pin 3 (NMEA Data Out) is not necessary.  

<h3>Using Serial to USB converters</h3>
<p>Most PC's no longer have a built in serial (RS-232) port. If you don't have a serial port, then
  purchase a serial to USB converter. 
  Follow the manufacturers installation instructions for the converter 
  and once installed connect your NMEA device. Your device will appear in the NMEA configuration 
  dialog as a normal serial port. 
</p>
<p>
Note that if you move the serial to USB converter to a different serial port, then your 
operating system may re-install the drivers and assign a different serial port number, 
in which case you will have to reconfigure the NMEA settings in PAMGUARD.

<h3>Using a USB GPS</h3>
<p>Some GPS's have an USB connector instead of a serial one. In reality, the data are still 
  the same serial data as from a GPS with a serial output, but a USB to serial converter has been built
  into the GPS. Therefore connect your GPS and install the manufacturers software drivers as you
  would for a serial to USB converter described above.

<h3>Connecting one NMEA source to Multiple Computers</h3>
<p>If you want to connect an NMEA device to multiple computers, then 
  it's generally possible to split an NMEA signal from a serial device and input it to 
  multiple serial ports. If you do do this, ensure that only pins 2 and 5 are connected.</p>
