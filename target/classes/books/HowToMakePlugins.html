<h1>Writing PAMGUARD Plug-ins</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2><br>
Most of the functionality of PAMGUARD is implemented in a series of plug-ins which 
either process data in some way and / or provide a display and / or provide 
graphic overlays for other built in displays. 
<p>
All PAMGUARD plug-ins are subclasses of <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>
<br>
To make a plug in, first create a subclass of <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>,
adding to the subclass the various components described below. Then add your new plug-in the the PAMGUARD
data model. See <a href="HowToAddPlugins.html">How to add plug-ins</a> to learn how to do this. 
<p>
Available components of a PAMGUARD plug-in are
<ol>
<li>A Process that modifies data in some way</li>
<li>A Tab panel display</li>
<li>A Side panel display</li>
<li>A Display Menu</li>
<li>A Detection menu</li>
<li>A File menu</li>
<li>Graphic Overlays</li>
<li>Plug in display panels</li>
</ol>

All components of a PAMGUARD plug-in are optional. The table shows existing plug-ins (end 2006) <br>
<img alt="Table of Pamguard plug-ins" src="./images/plugintable.png"/><br><br>

<h3>The Constructor</h3>
<p>
Although the default constructor for <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a> is 
<pre>
public PamControlledUnit(String unitType, String unitName)
</pre>
you must provide a constructor in your sub class that takes just the unitName, e.g.
<pre>
public class MyDetectorController extends PamControlledUnit {
  public MyDetectorController(String unitName) {
    super("My detector", unitName);
	  etc...
</pre>
Pamguard will search for and use this single parameter constructor when creating modules and adding them to the Pamguard data model. 

<h3>Pamguard Processes</h3>
<p>
Pamguard Processes are subclasses of <a href="../PamguardMVC/PamProcess.html">PamProcess</a>. 
A PamProcess will subscribe to one or more <a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataBlock.html">PamDataBlock(s)</a>. 
A PamProcess will generally also create one or more new
 <a href="href=PamguardMVC/PamDataBlock.html">PamDataBlock(s)</a>. 

When new data arrive from the PamDataBlock, the process will manipulate those data in some way and create information
that is added to the output data blocks.   
<p>
Each Pamguard plug-in may have any number of processes, for example, most displays do not have a process at all. The whistle
detector, on the other hand, has separate processes for peak detection and whistle linking. 
<p>
To add a process to a plug in, use the <A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#addPamProcess(PamguardMVC.PamProcess)">addPamProcess</A>
function in <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>Unit. 
<p>
<br>

<h3>PAMGUARD Tab Panels</h3>
<p>
PAMGUARD Tab panels are added as separate tabs on the main PAMGUARD GUI display. 
A tab panel may contain graphics or tables to display information of any type. 
<p>
Each PAMGUARD plug-in may currently only have a single tab panel per plug in. 
however, since the developer can put anything they like into that one tab panel,
it is of course possible to place a tab panel in that one tab panel and for the inner
tab panel to contain multiple tabs !
<p>
To add a tab panel to a plug in, use the <A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#setTabPanel(PamView.PamTabPanel)">setTabPanel</A>
function in <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>. 
<p>
<br>

<h3>Detection Menu</h3>
A process that requires a detection menu should override the function
<A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#createDetectionMenu(java.awt.Frame)">createDetectionMenu</A>
function in <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>. 
<p>
Note that a new detection menu may be created multiple times as modules are added and removed from 
the PAMGUARD system. Therefore the implementation of 
<A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#createDetectionMenu(java.awt.Frame)">createDetectionMenu</A>
should contain only a minimum amount of code required to make the actual menu and should avoid
calling constructors for additional objects. 
<p>
Detection menus will automatically be incorporated as sub-menus in PAMGUARD's main detection menu.
They will also be shown as separate menu items in the main menu bar when the tab panel (if one exists) for the
plug-in is selected. 

<p>
<br>

<h3>Display Menu</h3>
A process that requires a display menu should override the function
<A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#createDisplayMenu(java.awt.Frame)">createDisplayMenu</A>
function in <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>. 
<p>
Note that a new display menu may be created multiple times as modules are added and removed from 
the PAMGUARD system. Therefore the implementation of 
<A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#createDisplayMenu(java.awt.Frame)">createDisplayMenu</A>
should contain only a minimum amount of code required to make the actual menu and should avoid
calling constructors for additional objects. 
<p>
Display menus will automatically be incorporated as sub-menus in PAMGUARD's main display menu.
They will also be shown as separate menu items in the main menu bar when the tab panel (if one exists) for the
plug-in is selected. 
<p>
<br>

<h3>File Menu</h3>
A process that requires a display menu should override the function
<A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#createFileMenu(javax.swing.JFrame)">createFileMenu</A>
function in <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>. 
<p>
Note that a new display menu may be created multiple times as modules are added and removed from 
the PAMGUARD system. Therefore the implementation of 
<A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#createFileMenu(javax.swing.JFrame)">createFileMenu</A>
should contain only a minimum amount of code required to make the actual menu and should avoid
calling constructors for additional objects. 
<p>
File menus will automatically be incorporated as sub-menus in PAMGUARD's main file menu.
<p>
<br>

<h3>PAMGUARD Side Panels</h3>
Sets the side panel for the PamControlledUnit
Side panels are shown down the left hand side of 
the main PAMGUARD GUI and are always visible, irrespective
of which tab is being viewed on the main tabbed display. 
<p>
Side panels are generally used to display summary information
for the PamControlledUnit or to provide quick access controls. 
<p>
To add a side panel to a plug in, use the <A HREF="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html#setSidePanel(PamView.PamSidePanel)">setSidePanel</A>
function in <a href="../PamController/PamControlledUnit.html">PamControlledUnit</a>. 
<p>
<br>

<h3>Output Data Blocks</h3>
Most Pam Processes will produce now data in one form or another. Data are stored
as <a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataUnit.html">PamDataUnits</a> in 
<a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataBlock.html">PamDataBlock(s)</a>. 
<p>
In general, the 
<a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataBlock.html">PamDataBlock(s)</a> 
are created 
at the same time as the <a href="../PamguardMVC/PamProcess.html">PamProcess</a>.  
<a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataUnit.html">PamDataUnits</a> 
are then added to the 
<a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataBlock.html">PamDataBlock(s)</a> as and when they
become available. 
<p>
For some processes, such as the <A HREF="../fftManager/PamFFTControl.html" title="class in fftManager">FFT Engine</A>, 
<a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataUnit.html">PamDataUnits</a>  will be added to the output
<a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataBlock.html">PamDataBlock</a> at regular intervals.
For other processes, such as the 
<A HREF="../clickDetector/ClickControl.html" title="class in clickDetector">Click Detector</A>
new 
<a href="../PamguardMVC/PamDataUnit.html">PamDataUnits</a>  will be only be added if
and when detections are made. 
<p>
<br>

<h3>Graphic Overlays</h3>
As well as creating their own tab panel and side panels, PamProcess output can be
overlaid on pre-existing PAMGUARD displays. 
<p>
Displays that currently support graphic overlays are (as of December 2006)
<ol>
<li><A HREF="../Map/MapController.html" title="Map">The Map</A></li>
<li><A HREF="../Spectrogram/SpectrogramDisplay.html" title="Spectrogram">Spectrograms</A></li>
<li><A HREF="../radardisplay/radardisplay.html" title="Map">Radar Displays</A></li>
</ol>
For details of how to make graphic overlays in PAMGUARD see
<a href="HowToMakeOverlays.html">How to make graphic overlays</a>
<p>
<br>

<h3>Plug-in Display Panels</h3>
Sound data are often viewed on a scrolling 
<A HREF="../Spectrogram/SpectrogramDisplay.html" title="Spectrogram Display">Spectrogram Display</A>.
<br>
PAMGUARD plug-ins can provide additional scrolling display panels which can be 
added to the bottom of the spectrogram display in order to show data that are not
suitable for display in a graphic overlay. 
<p>
Scroll speed of plug-in panels is controlled by the spectrogram display so that 
the plug-in panel data remain in line with the spectrogram data.
